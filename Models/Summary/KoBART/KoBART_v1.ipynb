      "최근 김하성과 타티스 주니어의 평가가 엇갈린 가운데 코리안 메이저리거 기마성의 몸값이 친정부지로 오르고 있습니다 현재 페르난도 타티스 주니어가 징계를 마치고 샌디에이고로 돌아와도 유격수가 아닐 가능성이 커보인다는 외신들의 평의 집에 있습니다 aj 프렐라 샌디에이고 사장이 간판스타 페르난도 타티스 주니어의 멀티 포지션 가능성을 공식적으로 언급하면서 사장 역시 김하성에 대한 기대를 숨기지 않고 있다는 것입니다 지난 10월 금지 적발로 징계를 받은 파티스 주니어는 내년 4월 21일까지 메이저리그에서 뛸 수 없는 상황에서 최근 김하성이 공수 양쪽에서 성장의 유격수를 고민할 필요가 없기 때문입니다 얼마 전 열린 메이저리그 단장 회의에 타티스와 포지션 변경 문제를 놓고 심도 깊은 대화를 나누고 있다고 밝혔습니다 지난 시즌 샌디에이고는 역대 가장 큰 거액의 계약을 체결한 파티스 주니어를 메 주식을 슈퍼스타가 될 것이라 확신에 찾지만 오프 시즌서 발생한 오토바이 사고로 어깨 수술을 해 팀의 민폐를 끼치더니 복귀를 앞두고는 금지 약물 검사에서 양성반응이 나와 8경기 출장 정지를 받았기 때문입니다 미국 JN 스포츠에 따르면 파티스 주니어의 애매해진 수비 포지션도 적지 않은 영향을 끼쳤는데 특히 타티스가 20홈런 이상 칠 수 있는 어린 유격수라는 점 때문에 초대형 계약을 안겨준 것일뿐 수비면에서는 샌디에이고 평균 기댓값보다 못하는 평을 내렸고 그런데 기다렸다는 듯이 타티스 주니어가 없는 동안 그의 공백을 기마성이 채우며 골든 글러브 후보까지 등극하는 등 구단 내에서조차 예상밖에 활약에 타티스 주니어의 입지가 좁아지고 있던 것입니다 하지만 어디까지나 언론의 예상일뿐 샌디에고는 타티스 주니어의 내년 외야 이동의 명확한 답변을 내놓은 적은 없었지만 결국 프렐러 단장이 개인적으로 타티스 주니어에게 포지션에 대해 공식적인 언급이 발표되자 흐름이 180도 바뀌었습니다 프렐러 사장은 파티스는이기는 것이 가장 큰 목표라고 한다 내년 스프링캠프에서 우리가 그에게 기대하는 점이 무엇인지 확실히 하면서 어떤 옵션이 있는지 알려주고 적응 여부를 살펴볼 계획이다라며 다양한 포지션에서 뛸 가능성도 논의할 것이라고 언급한 것입니다 지금까지 타티스 주니어는 메이저리그에서 2루수로 뛴 적이 없고 마이너리그에서도 2017년 한 경기를 끝으로 이로 수비에 나선 적이 없는데 어느 하나 풀타임 주전 자리를 맡기기엔 애매한 선수라고 말할 수도 있습니다 파티스의 포지션 변경 가능성이 꾸준히 제기된다는 것은 곧 샌디에이고가 주전 유격수 기마성을 원한다는 얘기가 되는 것입니다 미국 dlatic 데니스 링 기자에 따르면 27살 김하성은 올해 골든 글러브에 도전했고 공격에서 눈에 띄는 발전 잃었다고 호평했습니다 그래서 사장은 타티스 주니어가 자리를 비운 사이 기마성이 등장하면서 모든 것이 바뀌었고 빈자리를 매운 기마성은 올해 582타석에 나서 11홈런 조정 OPS 107을 기록했으며 그런 기마성을 유격수에서 옮길 이유가 샌디에이고에게는 없을 것입니다 그러나 일각에선 구단이 기마성을 긍정적으로 바라본다 한데 타티스 주니어의 고집 때문에 유격수 경쟁은 더욱 치열할 것으로 보인다 밝혔습니다 그도 그럴 것이 타티스가 샌디에이고와의 계약 당시 주전 유격수를 보장해 줄 것을 계약 내용의 기재되어 있을 것이고 특히 테티스는 여전히 육격격수 자리를 원하고 있기 때문입니다 하지만 파티스의 생각과 달리 샌디에이고 파드리스 팬들은 기마성을 유격수로 보내는게 맞다는 입장입니다 인터뷰 내용에 따르면 그동안 파티스가 금지한 물로 메이저리그 기록을 세웠다면 약물 적발이 있던 선수가 성 부정적인 복귀는 그 누구도 없었다며 의구심을 내비쳤던 것입니다 espn도 기마성을 썩히는 것은 미친 짓이라며 차라리 타티스를 외할수 이처럼 다수 매체 유격수의 자리는 김하성의 것이라는 발언은 단순한 립 서비스로 보기는 어렵습니다 1년 전만 하더라도 김하성의 빅리그 주전자리는 상상하기 힘들었고 기존 선수의 부재로 생긴 기회를 확실하게 잡으며 당당하게 주전으로 올라섰습니다 이제는 미국 현지의 믿음도 점점 굳건해지는 분위기인데요 올해 샌디에이고는 정규시즌 89승 73패로 내셔널리그 와일드카드 2위로 포스트 시즌에 진출하는데 성공했으며 뉴욕 매치와 LA 다저스를 차례로 만나는 힘 대진이었지만 각각 2승 1패 3승 1패로 손쉽게 제압하고 챔피언십 시리즈까지 진출했습니다 파티스 주니어가 외야수로 포지션을 옮겨도 부상 위험해서 완전 자유로울 수 없다는 점을 지적했습니다 야구 포지션에서 어깨 부상 발생 비율이 육격수 2루수의 중앙내아가 12.9%이고 외야에선 31.6%라는 연구 결과를 근거로든 것인데요 반면 1루수의 어깨 부상 비율은 7.4%에 불과한만큼 카티스 주니어에게 가장 적합한 포지션이라는게 지배적입니다 그런데 메이저리그 최고 명문구단 뉴욕 양키스의 감독이 김하성 영입을 위해 비밀리에 추진하고 있다는 소식이 들려오고 있습니다 북미 뉴욕전 스포츠에 따르면 뉴욕 양키스의 앨런분 감독을 비롯해 양키스 구단 관계자들은 이번 포스트시즌 무기력한 패배의 원인은 양키스 내야진 수비가 문제라고 밝혔습니다 최근 양키스 수비수가 매우 불안하다라며 김하성이 양키스 유격수 자리를 꿰찰 것이라고 전했는데요 일각에선 샌디에이고에서 잘 적응하고 있는 기마성이 이적하는 건 말도 안 된다며 소리쳤지만이는 양키스 내부 관계자들의 발언으로 사실화되고 있습니다 에런본 감독은 휴스턴과의 4차전 경기 후 패배 원인에 대해 결정적인 수비 실책으로 인해 모든 것이 뒤바뀌었다며 양키스의 내야지는 내년 필요하다고 밝혔던 것입니다 뉴욕 안키스가 다가오는 이적 시장에서 대대적인 선수 방출을 단행할 것으로 예상되며 특히 김하성의 영입은 이미 내부 관계자들로부터 확인된 사실입니다 양키스 스카우터 존 맥켈에 따르면 현재 가장 포텐셜이 좋고 젊은 수비수를 대거 영입할 예정이다라며 여전히 젊고 대단한 활약을 했던 김화성을 지칭하는게 아니냐는 여론이 흘러나오고 있습니다 이에 양키스 팬들은 샌디에이고가 타티스 주니어를 육격수로 보낸다면 차라리 양키스로 이적을 해줬으면 좋겠다는 입장을 밝히나 있습니다 이번 트레이드에 관해 기마성 에이전시는 언론과의 접촉을 최대한 피하는 상황인데요 기존 선수의 부재로 생긴 기회를 확실하게 잡으며 당당하게 주전으로 올라선 기마성의 내년 활약이 벌써부터 기대가 되는 모습입니다  \n",

      "현재 박항서 감독을 떠나보낸 베트남이 인도네시아에 충격패를 당하며 동남아시안 게임에서 떨어진 가운데 박항서 후임 감독의 폭탄 발언이 베트남 현지를 경악하게 만들고 있습니다 박항서 후임 감독인 트로시의 감독은 베트남 축구대표팀의 부임하면서부터 스트레스에 연속이었습니다 베트남 축협은 다가오는 2026년 동남아 최초로 월드컵 본선에 반드시 진출해야 한다며 허구한 날 압박했고 베트남 언론들은 심심하면 박항서 감독과 비교를 하며 박항서 감독이 그립지 않게 박항서 감독보다 더 많은 우승 트로피를 선물해달라고 전했습니다 베트남은 이번에 열린 동남아시안 게임에서도 과거 박항서 감독이이 대회에서 2연패한 것을 상기시키며 베트남이 당연히 우승해야 하는 대회라며 떠들었는데요 베트남이 인도네시아의 충격패를 당하며 대회에서 탈락하자 베트남 전체가 뒤집혔습니다 당장 트로시의 감독을 경질시키고 박항서 감독만큼 할 수 있는 감독을 영입해야 한다고 소리쳤습니다 그런데 이런 상황에서 트루시에는 말 그대로 팩트 폭격을 날려서 엄청난 화제가 됐습니다 베트남 언론이 당연히 트루시의 감독은 박항서 감독이 했던 것만큼은 해야 한다고 말하고 그동안 쭉 박항서 감독과 비교해 온 것에 화가 나 있던 트루시에는 결국 폭발했는데요 그는 베트남의 현실을 촌철살인의 한마디로 정확히 알려주며 기자회견장을 경악하게 만들었습니다 과연 어떤 말을 했는지 자세한 내용 알아보겠습니다 동남아 최강이던 베트남이 동남아 올림픽이라 불리는 동남아시안 게임서 탈락했습니다 그러자 베트남 언론들과 팬들은 즉각적으로 박항서 감독을 찾았습니다 대회 3연패를 노리던 디펜딩 챔피언 베트남은 동메달 결정전으로 떨어졌습니다 베트남은 지난 두 대회 연속 우승을 차지한 바 있습니다 2019년과 코로나19 때문에 1년 연기되면서 지난해 열린 2021 대회에서 있다가 우승을 차지했습니다 베트남은 두 번 모두 태국과 결승에서 만나 1대0으로 승리 우승컵을 알았습니다 모두 박항서 감독 시절 쌓은 금자탑이었습니다 하지만 이번 대회에서 베트남은 인도네시아를 상대로 수적으로 우세한 경기를 펼치고도 번번이 결정적인 기회를 놓쳤습니다 결국 경 종료 직전 결정적인 중거리 슈팅을 허용하며 무너졌습니다 그러자 케네14 등 많은 베트남 언론들이 박항서 전 감독을 찾았습니다 박항서 감독을 트루시의 감독과 비교한 것입니다 트로시의 감독에게서는 박항서 감독의 리더쉽이 보이지를 않는다 박항서 감독이 경기장에 있으면 어떤 상대든 이길 수 있을 것 같은 인상을 줬다 하지만 트로시의 감독은 전혀 다르다 박항서 감독 시절에 단단한 조직력도 없다 박항서 감독은 무엇보다 팀의 결속을 중요시했고 특히 수비 조직력을 탄탄하게 만들었다 선수들은이기는 법을 알고 있었다 트로시의 감독이 팀을 맡은 지금은 선수들이 너무나도 헐거워진 느낌이다 이날 박항서 감독이 경기장을 찾아왔었다 경기가 끝나고 수많은 베트남 팬들은 박항서 감독을 향해 울부짖었다 경기 내용보다 박항서 감독의 방문이 더 화제가 됐다라고 언론들은 보도했습니다 박항서 감독은 이틀 전 일대일로 비긴 태국과 가진 조별리그 마지막 경기를 보기 위해 경기장을 찾기도 했습니다 당시 많은 현지 언론들이 박정 감독의 방문에 높은 관심을 보였습니다 박항 감독은 이날도 경기장을 찾았습니다 하지만 경기 집중력을 흐트릴 수 있는만큼 마스크를 쓴 채 조용히 경기를 지켜봤습니다 베트남 매체는 베트남 대표팀이 2대3으로 패하며 결승 진출이 좌절되자 트루시의 감독에 대한 비난이 커졌다 동남아시안 게임 2연패를 이끌던 베트남은 어디에 있는 것인가라고 보도했습니다 또한 경기에서 패배우 기자회견장의 참석한 트루시의 감독을 향해 박항서 감독이 이끌던 시절의 베트남 축구가 보이지 않는다 이게 어떻게 된 일인가 박항서 감독의 업적을 넘기 위해 당신을 선임했다 하지만 결과가 따르지 않은 것에 대해 어떤 책임감을 갖고 있는가라고 물었습니다 질문을 듣던 트로시의 감독은 잠시 눈을 질끈 감았는데요 그리고 이후 베트남 전체가 경악할 정도의 팩트폭격을 선사했습니다 올해 박항서 감독님은 베트남 대표팀 감독으로 5년여의 여정을 마무리했습니다 그리고 저는 베트남 유소년 대표팀을 맡으면서 오랜 시간 박 감독님과 함께 해왔습니다 그런데 당신들은 박 감독님의 업적을 잘 이해하지 못하고 있습니다 그의 업적은 수많은 우승 트로피 말한 것이 아니에요 베트남 축구의 역사 자체를 바꾼 것입니다 그것이 어떤 의미인지 생각해봐야 합니다 박 감독님의 업적을 당연하게 여기는 당신들의 태도가 얼마나 웃긴지도요 박 감독님은 베트남의 축구를 180도로 바꿔놓았습니다 박 감독님 체제에서 성장한 베트남 선수들이 해외 구단의 부름을 받는 일까지 생겼죠 공격수인 응우엔 꽁포엉이 벨기에 신트트라위던에 입단한 것은 베트남 선수 최초의 유럽 진출 사례였습니다 박 감독님이 부임하기 이전에는 꿈도 꿀 수 없는 일이었죠 동남아 지역에서 한국 지도자들의 인기가 높아진 데에도 박 감독의 역할이 적지 않습니다 그러니까 내가 하고 싶은 말은 박 감독님은 베트남을 넘어 동남아 축구 역사의 한 획을 그은 감독이라는 겁니다 과연 그가 없었다면 베트남이 그렇게 많은 우승을 할 수 있었을까요 저뿐만이 아니라 그 누구에게도 박 감동만큼의 업적을 당연히 내야 한다고 말한다면 그 말은 부당한 말일 겁니다 그가 동남아 역사상 최고의 감독이라는 것을 알고 있다면 말이죠 트루시의 감독의 말은 베트남인들의 뼈를 때렸는데요 일본 베트남 팬들은 어떤 반응을 보였을지 알아보겠습니다 베트남의 라이벌 의식을 갖고 있고 태국 축구의 거장인 남산 단장조차 박항서 감독에게는 존경의 뜻을 나타냈다 그는 베트남 언론에 직접 나와서 박항서는 동남아시아 축구를 바꿨다고 말했지 트로시의 감독의 말이 맞다 이것만 봐도 박항서 감독을 잡지 않은 베트남이 얼마나 멍청한 짓을 했는지 알 수 있다 베트남 축구는 박항서 감독의 정과 후로 나뉜다 5년 전만 해도 베트남은 말레이시아 인도네시아와 경쟁하던 동남아 2인자 그룹이었다 그러나 박항서 감독은 모든 것을 바꿔놨다 동남아 무대에선 태국의 여전히 강해도 더 넓은 아시아 무대에서는 베트남의 실적이 크게 앞선다 경쟁자였던 말레이시아와 인도네시아는 베트남 앞에서 명함도 내밀지 못했다 이게 다 박항서 감독 한 명이 바꿔놓은 것이다 박항서 감독은 단순한 전술가가 아니었다 선수 갈아넣기나 일회성 전략에 의한 한두번의 반짝 정도로 끝난 것이 아니라 기본 포텐셜과 축구 실력 자체의 성장을 이루었고 그로 인한 장기적인 베트남 성장을 바라볼 수 있게 되었다 우리는 왜 진작 이런 것들을 깨닫지 못했을까 트루시의 감독의 말대로 박항서 감독은 그저 트로피만 수집한게 아니라 동남아 역대 최고의 감독이다 v만지 1년 만에 베트남에 피파 랭킹이 배기로 올라갔다는 소식을 뉴스로 접할 때 기억이 아직도 생생하다 그가 베트남의 부임할 때 한 약속이 100일을 이루겠다는 것이었는데 부임 1년 만에 일어내버린 것이다 또한 1년 만에 베트남의 스즈키컵 우승까지 이뤄냈지 박항서 감독은 신이 내린 선물이었다 박항서 감독이 너무 그리워서 견딜 수가 없다 그는 진정으로 선수들을 사랑할 줄도 아는 감독이었다 2018 아시안 게임이 한창 진행 중이었을 때 박항서 감독은 직접 발 마사지 기계를 들고 선수들의 발을 정성스레 문질렀다 그는 선수들에게 아버지 같은 존재였을 것이다 박항서 감독이 다시 한번 베트남 감독으로 와줄 가능성은 없는 걸까 박항서 감독은 당초 베트남 감독을 오래할 생각도 없었다 그는 퇴임할 때 낯선 베트남의 장기간 있을 것으로 생각하지 못했다 생각보다 긴 말했었다 세상에는 예외적인 일이 많이 일어나듯이 박항서 감독이 다시 한번 베트남 감독을 맡아 월드컵 본선에 도전해 주었으면 한다 박항서 감독은 스스로 열심히 하는 사람이지 뛰어난 사람은 아니라고 했다 하지만 그것은 잘못된 말이다 박항서 감독은 두 번 다시 베트남에서 볼 수 없는 역대급 감독임에 분명하다 겸양의 말과 달리 그는 베트남에서 놀라운 성과를 냈다 박항서 감독이 지휘봉을 죽이 전 베트남 대표팀 성적은 참담했다 베트남의 피파 랭킹은 142권 동남아시아의 축구 맹주 자리도 내준지 올해였다 그와의 이별을 되돌릴 수 없다고 생각하니 눈물이 흐른다 트로시의 감독의 말대로 우리는 박항서 감독의 업적을 과소평가하는 경향이 있다 그는 모든 것을 바꿨다 경기 전 후에 필요한 식이요법이나 운동방법 같은 기초영역부터 세계 축구 흐름까지 10억하며 어미새가 먹이 주듯 차근차근 가르쳤다 5년여 만에 베트남 대표팀 수준을 한 단계 높인 것을 넘어 시스템을 근본적으로 뜯어고쳤다 박항서 감독은 선수들은 물론 축구 관계자들에게 자긍심과 책임감부터 가질 것을 주문했다 드디어 선수들과 축복의 관계자들 체질이 변하기 시작했다 그 당시 베트남 축구계는 외국인 감독의 부정적인 시각이었다 앞서 독일 브라질 포르투갈 등 축구 강국 지도자들에게 지휘봉을 맡긴 바 있다 하지만 이렇다 하게 성공을 거둔 사례는 눈을 씻고 봐도 없었다 베트남 축구가 일찍이 경험하지 못한 감동의 장면이었다 진심은 통한다는 기본에 뿌리를 둔 박항서 감독의 리더십은 두 번 다시 볼 수 없을 것이다 생생튜브 영상 여기서 마치겠습니다 감사합니다  \n",

      "시청 해 주셔서 진심으로 감사합니다 러시아가 실효 지배하고 있는 쿠릴열도 에서 러시아가 사실상 일본을 적국으로 가정하고 1월 8일에 지대공 미사일을 발사하지 자 일본이 당혹감을 감추지 못하고 있습니다 특히 일본의 앞마당 이라고 할 수 있는 이틀후 푸 섬에서 발사한 것으로 보여 일본이 더욱 긴장하고 있는 것으로 보입니다 일본엔 지금도 러시아를 향해 쿠릴 열도 내기 섬을 돌려달라고 요구하고 있습니다 그런데 이번에 러시아가 지대공 미사일을 발사하는 등 강경하게 대응하자 일본의 계획은 완전히 수포로 돌아가게 되었습니다 지난 1월 8일 러시아의 쿠릴열도 에서 지대공미사일 s300 v4 발사 훈련을 실시했다고 러시아 정부가 밝혔습니다 러시아의 극동 지역을 관할하는 부대 낸 동부 0 강구 인데요 동부 공관 분 n 이번 미사일 발사 훈련 장소를 자세히 밝히지 않았지만 아마도 2020년 12월에 s300 v4 를 설치한 이틀후 푸 섬으로 추측하고 있습니다 러시아 언론에 따르면 이번 지대공미사일 훈련에서는 적기가 러시아 영공을 침입했다 고 가정한 상태에서 훈련을 실시했다 고 전했습니다 물론 러시아 언론에서 는 적국이 어느 국가인 지 정확하게 표현 하지는 않았습니다 그러나 누가 봐도 러시아의 적국이 일본 이라는 사실을 쉽게 확인할 수 있었습니다 지정학적 위치상 쿠릴 열도 4개의 성은 경제적인 문제를 떠나 일본의 국방과 안보를 심각하게 위협할 수 있을 정도로 일본과 매우 가깝습니다 따라서 이러한 지정학적 위치 때문에 쿠릴 열도에 관심이 가장 많은 국가 넨 사실상 일본 이라고 할 수 있는데요 그런데 러시아는 현재 쿠릴 열도 4개의 섬 에 대한 반한 문제로 인해서 일본과 첨예하게 갈등을 겪고 있습니다 일본엔 1855년 무역 및 국경 조약 을 언급하며 쿠릴 열도의 남쪽 섬 이 니트룩 구성 쿠나 씰의 섬 식고 탄 솜 합 엄마의 섬 등 내게서 뭘 일본 소유라고 주장하고 있습니다 그러나 러시아는 쿠릴 열도 네 개의 섬은 2차 세계대전 이후 소련의 적법하게 귀속되어 따고 주장하고 있습니다 그러면서 제 2차 세계대전 전승 구긴 러시아와 해 전국 인 일본의 배상 문제를 규정한 1951년 샌프란시스코 강화 조약 에 따라 합법적 으로 러시아의 귀속되어 따면서 절대로 반할 수 없다는 입장을 고수하고 있습니다 따라서 4개의 성은 의심할 여지없이 러시아의 소유라는 것이 며 현재도 러시아가 실효 지배하고 있습니다 그런 자 일본은 최근에도 여러 차례 러시아에게 쿠릴 열도 4개의 섬 에 대해서 반환을 요구하는 등 러시아 를 향해 계속해서 도 발했습니다 그러자 러시아가 일본을 강력하게 응징하게 따는 각오로 일본을 사실상 적국으로 가정하고 지대공 미사일을 발사한 것으로 보입니다 따라서 러시아 언론에 따르면 이번 훈련을 통해 목표물을 탐지하고 식별 그리고 추적하는 등 적국이 침입했다는 가정하에 시뮬레이션의 의 일환으로 지대공 미사일을 발사했다 고 발표했습니다 s300 v4 의 지대공 미사일은 탄도 미사일과 항공기 등에 대한 요격 능력이 매우 높은 것으로 알려져 있습니다 또한 4 거리는 대략 400km 라고 발표했습니다 물론 어느 국가나 미사일을 발사하며 군사훈련을 실시할 수는 있습니다 하지만 지정학적인 위치 가 문제인데요 이번에 러시아가 지대공 미사일을 발사한 것으로 보이는 이 트 루 푸 성은 사실상 일본의 앞마당 이라고 할 수 있을 정도로 일본과 매우 가까운 지역이어서 일본 정부의 긴장도가 매우 높은 것으로 보입니다 이처럼 러시아가 일본을 향한 강력한 메시지는 이뿐만이 아니었습니다 최근 일본이 쿠릴 열도에 대한 도발을 계속하자 러시아는 일본을 향해 본때를 보여 주겠다며 쿠릴열도 에서 군사훈련을 대규모로 늘렸습니다 러시아 언론에 따르면 2019년 4월에 러시아 국방부가 쿠릴 열도 중 하나인 흐 나 씰의 섬에서 반공 전투 임무 구역이 도입되었다 고 발표했습니다 러시아가 일본을 향한 강력대응 은 이뿐만이 아닙니다 러시아 질의 학회 대표들이 쿠릴열도 가 없는 러시아 영토 이미지에 대해서 행정적인 책임을 확립하는 법안을 준비하고 있습니다 러시아 지리 학회 대표 들에 따르면 이지아는 일본의 지도 침략에 대한 대응이라고 명확하게 밝히고 있습니다 지난해 11월에 일본에서는 사진전을 통해 쿠릴 열도 4개의 섬 에 대해서 홋카이도 관광과 관련된 책자가 일본인들을 향해 배포가 되었습니다 사실상 일본 정부가 쿠릴열도 4개의 섬이 일본의 소유라고 주장한 것인데요 일본이 이처럼 쿠릴열도 4개의 섬 에 대해서 지도를 왜곡하지 자 이에 대한 책임과 지리적 용어를 잘 머스 난 책임에 대해 러시아가 작정하고 벌금을 책정 하게 따는 법안을 준비하고 있는 상황입니다 이뿐만 아니라 일본이 도발을 계속하자 최근까지도 쿠릴 열도 에서 대규모 사격 훈련을 하는 등 러시아가 일본을 향해 따끔하게 경고 않은 상황이 계속되었습니다 그러자 일본 엔 여러 차례 쿠릴 열도 해서 러시아가 군사력을 강화하고 사격 훈련을 하는 것은 일본 정부의 입장과 넨 매우 상충 된다 며 강력하게 항의하고 있습니다 이와 더불어 일본 외무성이 주일 러시아 대사관에 도 강력하게 항의해 했는데요 하지만 러시아는 일본의 요구를 철저하게 묵살하고 오히려 더욱 강경한 자세를 취하고 있습니다 지난해 12월 15일에도 러시아 정보 수집기 1대와 러시아 항공기 8대가 동해와 태평양 을 왕복하며 일본을 위협했습니다 그리고 일본 2항의 하면 할수록 더욱 많은 사격 훈련을 실시하고 있는 것으로 보이는데요 지난해 12월 달에는 16일과 23일 그리고 30일까지 무려 세 차례나 사격 훈련을 실시해 일본의 코를 납작하게 만들었습니다 또한 지난해 러시아의 푸틴 대통령은 쿠릴 열도를 발전시키기 위해서 관세 등을 면제하는 특별구 를 창설 한다고 발표했습니다 극동 블라디보스토크에서 개최된 러시아 정부 주최 에 동방 경제포럼 전체회의 에서 밝힌 것인데요 사실상 러시아가 일본을 향해 쿠릴 열도 4개의 섬을 완전히 포기하라 낸 무언의 압박으로 보입니다 또한 최근 일본에서는 또다시 정말 황당한 오류가 발생해 일본인들이 매우 큰 불편을 겪고 있는데요 일본에서도 최근 지하철역에 ic 카드 식 물품 보관소가 설치 되었습니다 그런데 놀랍게도 절도 가 많이 발생해 논란이 되고 있는데요 그 이유는 ic 카드 씩 물품 보관소에 오류가 발생한 것이 원인으로 지목되고 있습니다 정말 일본의 디지털 기술이 또다시 형편 없다는 사실이 드러난 것인데요 일본의 지하철역에 있는 ic 카드 식물 풍 보관소에서 사용자가 잠금장치를 하기 전에 사용가능 램프가 꺼지는 심각한 오류가 발생한 것입니다 따라서 사용자들은 사용가능 램프가 꺼지자 잠겨 있다고 착각하는 경우가 많았다고 하는데요 그로인해 물품 보관소에 나 커가 잠겨있지 않은 경우가 많아 절도 가 많이 발생했다는 것입니다 특히 이러한 ic 카드 식물 풍 보관소를 제조한 일본 기업에 따르면 같은 타입의 락커가 도쿄와 오사카 등 주역 에 설치되어 있다 고 언급하자 일본 경찰들은 주의를 호소하고 있다 고 전했습니다 물품 보관소에 가장 기본중에 기본이 잠금 기능인데 일본에서는 그 잠금기능 조차 제대로 작동되지 못한 사태가 드러난 것인데요 이처럼 일본에서 디지털 기술의 심각한 오류 때문에 일본 기업의 디지털 기술에 대한 불신이 더욱 커져서 일본인들이 여전히 아날로그 방식을 선호하는 것으로 보입니다 은 일본이 쿠릴 열도를 반환 해달라며 러시아를 계속 도발하고 있습니다 그러자 러시아는 지대공 미사일을 발사하는 등 일본을 사실상 적국으로 가정하고 강력하게 응징한 것으로 보입니다 최근 일본은 독도를 향해 강력하게 도발하고 있습니다 대한민국 역시 일본이 도발하면 도발 할수록 일본을 향해 더욱 강력하게 대응해야 할 것으로 보입니다 러시아가 일본을 향해 강력히 응징한 것에 대해서 시청자 님들의 생각은 어떠신가요 오늘 준비한 영상은 여기까지입니다 시청자 님들 항상 건강하시고 복 많이 받으세요 \n",

      "오 노캔  잘하시네 안녕하세요 이사입니다 드디어 제가 원했던 기다리고 기다리고 기다렸던 노이즈 캔슬링 헤드폰이 새롭게 출시했습니다 한국에서도 매년 특히 겨울철 오버이어 노이즈 캔슬링 헤드폰의 사용자가 점점 늘어가고 있고 개인적으로 노이즈 캔슬링이 하면 보스가 떠오는만큼 보스의 노이즈 캔슬링 신제품을 저는 좀 기다려 왔습니다 왜냐면 보스도 QC 3라는 노캔 헤드폰이 2016년에 출시했고 이후 새로운 제품이라기보다는 제품들 뭐 이제 QC 45와 같은 요러 제품이 출시해서 좀 아쉬웠는데 2023년 9월 14일 진짜 새로운 디자인을 가진 신제품이 공개되었습니다 그래서 저도 한국 정발 하기 전에 미리 받아서 보스의 QC 울트라 언박싱 그리고 첫인상을 이야기해 보려고 해요요 제품은 완전 완전히 이제 QC 제품의 후속작이라 그보다 많은 사람들이 알 수도 있지만 모를 수도 있는 NC 700이 모델의 후속작 격이기 하거든요 어찌됐든 보스에서 오랜만에 출시하는 제품이라 관심도가 많은 제품이고 그리고 신기했던 건 글로벌 런칭가 429달러 단순히 우리가 부가세 포함해서 계산해도 한 63만 원이라서 와 이거는 좀 쉽지 않겠는데 했는데 한국의 정말한 가격은 49만 99,000원에 출시했습니다 보스가 한국에 웬 일이래요 자 언박싱할 수 있는요 테이프는 여기 있는데 제가 아까 전에 던져 받으면서 이게 미리 좀 떼어 버리긴 했어요 근데 박스는 기존 제품과 크게 차이가 나지 않는 거 같은데요 그만 이제 좀 특징이 있다면 이제 각종 인증들을 좀 많이 받았더라고요 메이드포 아이폰과 아이패드 인정도 받았고 뭐 안드로이드 그리고 심지어 스냅드래곤 사운드 인증까지 받은 제품입니다 뭐뭐 각종 인증을 받았다 뭐요 정도까지 하고 자 구성품은 어 요것도 살짝 잡아서 들어올릴 수 있게 만들어놨네 이렇게 들어올리면 안쪽에 우 와 나는 개인적으로 보스의 파우치가 좀 마음에 들어 파우치도 엄청 흐물흐물 하잖아요 그럼 보관하고 들고 다닐 때도 불편한데 파우치는 고급스러운 느낌이 확 들어요 화이크 스모크는 때가 좀 탈 것 같지만 오 그래도 되게 예쁩니다 부성 부은 여기 다 들어 있어요 여기 보면 어 안쪽에 오 케이블 두 개 들어 있네 보스는 특이하게이 케이블의 특징이 뭐냐면 일반적인 3.5파이 케이블을 주지 않더라고요 한쪽은 3.5 한쪽은 2.5파이 오디오 케이블을 주고요 a2c 케이블도 함께 들어 있습니다 오 케이블 퀄리티가 의외로 좋네 오 케이블 퀄리티가 괜찮아요 그리고 오른쪽에 봉 anche 보스 QC 울트라 오랜만에 나온 신제품이 들어 있습니다 헤드폰을 접을 수 있게 들어 있어서 되게 콤팩트하게 들고 다닐 수 있게 되어 있구나 색상은 화이트 스모크 밝은색이 있고요 또 하나는 블랙 두 가지의 컬러로 출시했습니다 제가 미리 써본 컬러는 블랙이고 사실 저는 이렇게 이제 노캔 헤드폰이 예전에 유행하지 않을 때는 밖에서 쓰고 다니기 약간 민망해서 블랙이 좋았지만 이제는 많은 사람들이 노캔 헤드폰을 많이 쓴단 말이에요 그렇다 보니까 이제는 좀 당당해져 저는 요런 이제 밝은 톤의 헤드폰을 더 좋아하는 편입니다 그리고 디자인도 많이 바뀌었습니다 보스의 투박한 디자인에서 많이 세련된 깔끔해진 느낌이랄까요 예를 들어 이것과 부분에도 아무것도 없이 버스 로그만 있고 되게 깔끔하죠 QC 45는 오른쪽 유닛에 요렇게 이제 전원 온오프 그리고 블루투스 페어링 버튼이 있었지만 곳이 사라지고 하단에 버튼이 생기면서 이어컵 부분에서는 되게 깔끔한 디자인으로 모두 변경이 되었습니다 그렇다 보니 일주일 가량 사용하면서 좋았던 점은 고급감이 더 좋아졌다는 것 그래서 이게 왜 이렇게 고급감이 이런 버튼들로 숨겨서 더 좋아졌나 이런 생각을 했는데 전체적으로 보면 나사를 눈에 보이지 않는 것으로 많이 숨겼더니 곳에 이렇게 곳곳에 박혀 있기 때문에 뭔가이 전자 제품이라는 느낌이 있잖아요 하지만 울트라는 안쪽에 눈에 잘 보이지 않는 곳에 숨기면서 되게 깔끔한 디자인으로 좀 더 고급스럽게 만들었다라는 될 것 같습니다 아 그것도 있다 길 조절 할때도 좀 달라요 기존은 요렇게 조절했어요 울트라는 약간은 경박 hel 수 있는 소리에서 부드럽게 길리 조절할 수 있게 바뀐 것 이렇다 보니까 전체적인 경험에서 더욱 고급스럽게 느껴졌습니다 휴대성을 위해 기존과 마찬가지로 접히는 디자인도 유지를 했고 렇게 돌아가기도 해요 또 좋았던 점도 있습니다 원래 이어컵 부분이 기존 제품들은 요것을 분해하고 탈부착 시키기가 좀 많이 어려웠거든요 하지만 이번에는 조금 더 쉽게 빼고 장착할 수 있도록 바뀌었고요 이어컵은 사실상 이제 좀 만져 보면 얘가 전작보다는 더 매트해습니다 그래서 이제 조금 사용해 보면 주름이 더 많이 지기도 해요 나머지 포트들은 C 타입이 왼쪽으로 옮겨 졌고요 볼륨 조절은 터치식으로 바뀌었습니다 튀어 나와 있는 부분에 터치로 내리거나 올리면서 볼륨 조절할 수 있게 바뀐 깔끔한 디자인으로 변경되었습니다 다음은 착용감 보스 헤드폰이 착용감이 좋기로 되게 유명해요 그래서 이제 착용감을 한번 보여 드리자면 블랙 화이트 스모크 요거 또 QC 4호랑 비교한다면 확연한 차이가 존재했어요 외관적인 부분은 헤어밴드 윗부분이 좀 하드한 소재로 바뀌었거든요 안쪽에 메탈이 있을 수도 있고 좀 단단한 소재로 바뀌었고 아래쪽에는 엄청요 쿠션감이 두툼하게 있어서 부드럽고 푹신한 소재로 변경되었습니다 그래서 이제 오랫동안 착용했을 때 특히 헤어밴드 그 머리 윗 부분으로는 압박되는 느낌이 전혀 없었고요 귀에 닿는 부분은 안쪽으로 감기는 느낌이 있는 그런 착용감이 있습니다 원래 귀에 착용하자아요 그럼 다른 제품들은 부피를 줄이기 위해 안쪽이 되게 평평하게 되어 있단 말이에요 그렇게 되면 귀에 닿았을 때 귀가 드라이버에 닿을랑 말랑하면서 또 움직이면 요게 착착착착 렇게 닿아서 살짝 거슬리거나 보스는 고런게 없어요 이유는요 요거를 빼보면 알 수 있는데 지금 여기 보면 평평하지 않고 드라이버가 귀 방향에 맞게 안쪽으로 들어가 있기 때문에 착용했을 때 드라이버가 귀에 닿지 않아서 요것도 느낌이 되게 좋아요 착용시의 밀착 값은 QC 4호와 비교했을 때 크게 차이가 나지는 않지만 울트라가 조금 더 밀착력이 좋아진듯한 그런 느낌이 들기도 했습니다 이렇게 밀착력을 조금 계산했다는 건 고역대의 노캔 성능을 위해서 계산한 느낌이랄까요 그러니까 이제 정확하게 착용감 느낌이 어떠냐면 자 QC 사워를 했을 때 전체적으로 안으로 밀리도록 쪼이는듯한 느낌이라면 울트라는 헤어밴드 부분이 달라지면서 뭔가이 위쪽에서 좀 압박되는 느낌이 살짝 줄어들었습니다 근데 쓰다 보니 좀 이제 묘한게 뭐냐면 이어 쿠션이 좀 바뀌었다고 했잖아요 요게 묘하게 인조가죽의 느낌이나요 그래서 살짝 부드러우면서 살짝 딱딱함을 바뀐듯한 느낌이 들었기 때문에 저는 저어도 도이 착용감은 새로운 버전이 더 좋지만 이어컵 부분의 그 쿠션 느낌은 기존 버전이 더 좋게 느껴졌습니다 얘는 꽤 쓴 건데도 되게 부드러워요 차이가 많이 나는데요 아 그것도 있다 요거는 착용감이 아니라 사용성에 관한 문제인데 기존 모델들은 착용 감지 센서가 없어서 착용을 하나 벗어나 뭐 노래 일시 정지라는 자동 꺼진 기능이라든지 요런게 없었는데 새로운 버전은 착용 감지 센서가 들어갔기 때문에 벗으면 일시 장지 착용하면 재생 전원을 자동으로 온오프하는 기능이 새롭게 추가 되었더라고요 그것도 뭐 온오프 할 수도 있고요 다음으로 많이 궁금해하실 부분이 노이즈 캔슬링이 라고 생각해요 야 역시 보스가 노캔 맛집이 맞긴 맞아요 이전에도 그거 있잖아요 보스 QC 이어버드 2가 나왔을 때도 노캔 성능이 죽여 준 것처럼 QC 울트라 또한 노캔 성능이 훌륭했습니다 이게 또 어떤 차이점이 있냐면 아 이게 자꾸 QC 4호랑 비교하게 되는데 전체적인 느낌은 물리적으로 미세하게 고역대의 노이즈를 조금 더 차단을 더 잘해주고 저역대의 성능이 더 강화된게 체감되었다 특히 길가다가 요즘 오토바이가 많잖아요 오토바이 지나갈 때 노이즈 삭제 정도가 확실히 체감될 정도 카페에서도 노캔 성능을 체감할 수 있었어 니다 고역 대는 어쩔 수 없이 노이즈가 좀 많이 들어오는 편이긴 하지만 이제는 저역대는 웬만하면 거의 걸러 준다는 정도로 발전했다 랄까요 대충 서음이 어느 정도로 들어오냐면 이제 저역대는 많이 걸러주고 그나마 사람의 목소리부터 조금 조금씩 들어오다가 고역대가 들어와요 어쩌면 노캔 성능이 강하다 보니까 조금 먹먹하다는 느낌을 받을 수 있는 제품이긴 하지만 이거는 노캔 강도 설정이 가능하고 그렇기 때문에 그러한 정도를 느낄 수 있는만큼 저역대의 성능이 더욱 많이 증가했다는 것을 노래를 틀지 않아도 체감할 수 있었으 니다 아 그것도 있어요 노캔은 껐을 때 그 어웨어 모드 있잖아요 거기서도 훨씬 자연스러운게 체감 되더라고요 큐시 사우는 헤드폰을 끼고 그냥 노캔은 끈 그 물리적으로 노이즈가 차단된 느낌이라면 울트라는 주변 소리가 엄청 잘 들려요 어떠한 느낌이냐면 요렇게 쓴 것 벗은 것 그렇게 큰 차이가 안 날 정도로 되게 자연스러웠습니다 게다가 구입하신 분들 아실 텐데 말을 해보면 주변 소음이 함께 들리면서 내 목소리가 들리는 정도의 차이가 되게 많이 체감 되실 거예요 또 마이크의 위치가 모두 사이드 측면으로 옮겨졌기 때문에 윈드 노이즈에 대한 영향도 테스트해 본 결과 아주 없는 것은 아니지만 상당히 많이 개선되었고 아마 QC 울트라로 써 보면 노회는 타사대비 진짜 훌륭할 정도라고 느낄 정도로 되게 많이 발전했습니다 그럼 음질에 대해서 어떨까 보스는 오디오 에어 가드를 위한 헤드폰인만큼 이번에는 새로운 버스의 커스텀 충 기술이 들어갔다고 합니다 요거는 따로 뭐 온오프 할 수 있는 기능은 아니고 헤드폰을 쓰고 처음에 켜게 되면 참음이 나거든요 그럼 그 소리로 귀 모양을 분석해서 그에 맞는 사운드를 조절해 준다고 해요 그서 내가 따로 건들 지 않아도 자연스럽게 튜닝이 되는 거죠 그럼 음악을 들었을 때이 느낌은 어떨까 울트라로 들으면 아 이천 느낌은 저음이 확연히 강해진게 체감할 수 있었습니다 어 그러니까 이제 음악을 듣는 재미가 조금 더 증가한 느낌이랄까요 근데 그건 있었어요 얘를 첫곡으로 들었을 때 어 이게 사운드가 달라진게 맞나 그런 생각이 들기도 했었는데 시 4호로 들으면 확연히 역체감이 와 역체감이 진짜 많이 나더라고요 그러니까 예를 듣다가 예를 들으면 소리가 밋밋해진 느낌이랄까요 대신 고역 때는 QC 4호가 조금 더 강하게 살짝은 쏘는듯한 느낌이 들기도 해요 두 번째 곡을 들었을 때 큐시 사오는 위고가 마찬가지로 고역대가 더욱 강조된 사운드를 들려줬습니다 울트라를 듣다가 예를 들으면 소리가 조금 더 날카로운 느낌이 들기 때문에 오래 듣게 된다면 조금 더 피로감을 느낄 수 있을 것 같기도 하지만 대신 짧은 시간을 들으면 이러 성향 때문에 소리가 조금 더 시원한 선명화듯한 느낌을 받을 수 있을 거예요 근데 이게 자꾸 듣다 보니까 얘는 좀 오래 써서 그런지 한 번씩 끊김 있는데 그거는 좀 오래 써서 그런가 다시 울트라로 왔을 때는 저음이 자연스럽게 더욱 강해진 것을 제감 할 수 있었습니다 고역대의 특징이라면 좀 더 둥그러진 그리 날카롭지도 않은 전체적으로 부드러우면서 점이 더 다듬어진듯한 그런 사운드를 들려 줬죠 다음 곡을 4호로 먼저 들었을 때 역시 보스라는 생각이 들 정도로 다른 부분보다 점이 강조된 사운드를 들려줬습니다 근데 이때부터 그 차이가 났어요 이렇게 왔다 갔다 하면서 듣다 보니까 울트라를 듣다가 사우러 오면 어 이게 왜 점질 럼 느껴지지 그런 사운드 특히 저 역대가 노이즈가 조금 섞긴듯한 사운드가 들리기도 해요 이것도 이제 역체 때문인지 울트라로 듣다가 예를 들면 살짝 eql 만진듯한 그런 느낌이 들기도 했고요 그리고 다시 울트라로 왔을 때는 저음이 훨씬 강하다라는 느낌을 받을 수 있었습니다 대신 이제 저음이 너무 강하기 때문에 보컬이 살짝 이제 묻히는듯한 느낌이 있기도 하고 신기했던 건 처음에 들었을 때는 소리가 막 엄청 드라마틱한 변화 특색 있는 소리라는 느낌이 들지 않았는데 사월을 듣다가 울트라로 다시 오니까 와 확실히 사운드가 울트라라이트만큼 훨씬 더 좋아요 한 번씩 진짜 막 디테일한 소리가 들려서 어 이런 소리가 들렸 나라는 싶을 정도로 어 그런 부분에서 좀 차이를 느낄 수 있었고 볼륨을 높이더라도 일정한 사운드를 들려주는게 마음에 들었습니다 마지막은 요즘 아이폰에서 이번에 이제 티타늄을 적용한만큼 티타늄을 들어봤는데 위에 있는 노래들이 좀 다르게 들리긴 하더라고요 이때는 더 이제 QC 45와 울트라의 차이가 더 많이 느껴졌습니다 이만큼은 얘가 공간감이 답답하다는 느낌이 들었고 고이나 다른 영역은 조금 더 시원하게 얘가 더 들리는 느낌인데 점이 어 얘는 점을 인위적으로 부스팅 한 느낌 진짜 이곡은 울트라가 확실히 더 잘 표현을 해 줘요 소리가 전체적으로 깔끔하면서 저음이 강조된 사운드를 들려줬고 베이스가 특히 여기서 느꼈던 이제 자잘한 노이즈 없이 깔끔한 소리 그러니까 뭐랄까 걸음망 필터를 지나서 깔끔한 소리만 들리는 느낌 보걸이 조금 묻히는 거 빼고는 전체적으로 깔끔한 사운드가 마음에 들더라고요 종합적으로 봤을 때 처음 예를 들으면 이게 좋아졌나라는 생각이 들었지만 QC 4호를 다시 쓰는 순간 역체감이 엄청 크게 체감이 되었고 조금 과장을 하자면 살짝 인위적인 베이스의 음질이 살짝 안 좋은 것처럼 느껴지기도 했어요 제 생각에 이번에 에 살짝 인위적이었던 저음이 리얼한 저음으로 느껴져서인지 전체적인 밸런스가 너무 깔끔하다고 느껴졌지만 보컬이 좀 묻히는게 아쉬웠던 이유를 찾아보니까 그 모립 오디오를 새롭게 이번에 추가해서 그렇게 된게 아닐까 싶기도 했습니다 모립 오디오는 우리가 많이 아는 것처럼 공간 음양이 보면 되거든요 이때는 음악의 장르에 따라서 조금 이제 차이가 존재하긴 하는데 전체적인 성향은 한 공간에서 입체 음량 그러니까 마치 콘서트 홀에 온 것처럼 선명한 입체적인 음양이 들리면서 되게 재밌는 소리를 들려 줘요 하지만 아마 이제 보컬 위주의 음악을 듣는다면 악기와 보컬 서리 중간에서 이제 미묘하게 분리를 해서 공간감은 아주 좋은데 보컬을 약간 인지적으로 분리를 시켜서인지 보컬 위주의 음악에서는 야 조금 아쉬울 수도 있다 그래서 적절이 석기는 음냥 신나는 음악에서는 효과가 아주 좋고 특히 영상 컨텐츠에서 되게 좋았어요 넷플릭스 블랙미러가 공간 음량을 지원하는데 아 그때는 진짜 좋아요 그리고 마이크 성능도 테스트를 해봤는데 마이크도 기존에 비해서는 더 많이 좋아졌습니다 정확하게 어떠한 차이냐 men 이제 조용할 때는 비슷하게 마이크의 퀄리티가 느껴지거든요 하지만 자 는 순간이 두 개의 마이크 퀄리티가 존재해요 기존 제품에 비해서 마이크의 위치가 조금 변경되었기 때문에 아마 통화 품질에서도 전작 대비 조금 더 많은 차이를 보이지 않을까 싶습니다에서 재도 오토바이도 지나가고 있는 조태제 아쉬 냐면 이트라 좋고 착용감도 좋고 음질도 개선되어서 너무 좋은데 타사 대비 노이즈가 많은 환경에서 마이크의 성능이 아쉽다는게 제일 아쉬워요 마지막으로 앱이랑 여러 가지 이야기를 하자면 아 이번 보스 헤드폰이 좋아진게 뭐냐면 아까 말했다시피 여기 스냅드래곤 사운드가 새롭게 추가되었습니다 요거는 2021년 3월 4일에 발표된 기술이 든요 쉽게 이야기하자면 딜레이도 더 짧게 더 고음질 음원을 재생할 수 있는 코덱이 이야기하면 쉽습니다 일반적으로 aptx 어댑티브 블루투스 코덱을 사용하는데 결과적으로 이야기해서 한국에서 이것을 쓰기에는 매우 어려운 환경이긴 합니다 아 이게 안드로이드에서만 지원하는데 갤럭시는 지원하지 않기 때문이에요 추측해 보자면 삼성에서는 SSC는 코덱이 있기 때문에 뭐 요런 걸 지원하지 않는 거 같은데 그래서 헤드폰이 지원하지만 단말기가 한국에서는 거의 없기 때문에 좀 아쉬운 코덱이다 아무튼 앱을 좀 보자면 모드는 렇게 여러 가지로 설정할 수 있습니다 노이즈 캔슬링을 켜고 끄거나 몰입 요것도 있고 노이즈 캔슬링 정도 요러한 모드 이름을 지정해서 설정할 수 있고요 보스는 예전부터 멀티 포인트를 지원하기 때문에 동시에 두 대의 연결 뭐 최대 연결한다면 뭐 여덟 개까지 연결해 놓고 사용할 수 있는 기능 이것도 당연히 지원하고 EQ 설정할 수 있는데 요거는 조금 이제 보스가 아쉬운 부분이에요 왜냐면 이제 타선은 좀 더 다양하게 설정할 수 있는 것에 비해 보스는 세 단계로만 이제 왔다 갔다 해야 한다는 점이 좀 아쉽고 이번에 새롭게 추가된 것이요 모리 보 이오요구르트요 그거거든요 모리 오디오를 사용하면 정적 요걸로 했을 때는 오디오가 제자리에 있고 내가 고개를 돌릴 때마다 아 내가 움직이구 요거를 체감할 수 있는 기능 동적으로 바꾸게 된다면 소리가 내 머리에 따라서 요렇게 움직여 주는 이렇게 설정할 수 있습니다 그리고 바로가기 버튼도 새롭게 추가되었어요 여기서 이제 아까 나왔던 그 이제 튀어나와 있는 부분 거기를 꾹 눌렀을 때 요러 이제 바로 가기를 설정할 수 있고요 기존에 없었던 헤드폰 이제 착용 감지 요것도 온오프 할 수 있는 요러한 기능이 있습니다 배터리는 한번 충전했을 때 24시간 재생 가능하고 15분 급속 충전으로 최대 2시간 30분 사용 가능하다고 해요 그리고 가장 최신의 블루투스 5.3으로 사용하기 때문에 약 이제 한 9m 내서 사용할 수 있는 최신 기술을 탑재했다 결론적으로 제가 사용해 본 경험으로는 노켓 마집 보스에서 진짜 몇 년 만에 신제품이 나와서인지 되게 마음에 들어요 특히 디자인도 되게 깔끔하게 조금 더 고급스럽게 바뀌었기 때문에 그것도 되게 마음에 들고 어떻게 생각하면 글로벌 런칭 가인 429달러 환율을 그대로 적용해서 한국에 출시하게 된다면 가격대비 좀 아쉬웠을 것 같거든요 근데 지금 출고가로 진짜이 가격대라면 아주 적당히 잘 나왔다고 봐요 요것도 할인을 하게 된다면 거의 한 40만 원 초반대로 구입할 수 있는데 와 그 정도라면 진짜 괜찮은 가격이지 않나 아쉬운 건 한국에서 스냅드래곤 사운드를 제대로 맛볼 수 있는 환경이 아니라는 점 노이즈가 있는 환경에서는 마이크 성능이 좀 떨어진다는 점이 아쉬운 부분이고 QC 울트라를 정리하자면 착용감 노캔 성능이 좋은 노이즈 캔슬링 헤드폰이라고 보면 될 것 같습니다 특히 기존의 보스 사운드 QC 35나 QC 45의 사운드를 좋아하셨던 분들은 특히 베이스가 더욱 깔끔해졌다 것을 크게 느끼실 수 있을 거예요 아무튼 오늘 여기까지면 이제 노캔이 계절 겨울이 점점 다가오기 때문에 새로운 노이즈 캔슬링을 구입하고 싶으셨던 분들 중에서 어떠한 것을 구입할까 고민하셨던 분들은 어차피 뭐 이제 가격대가 있다 보니까 뭐 바로 구입해도 좋고 아니면 청음을 한번 해보고 구입하시면 좋을 것 같습니다 야 진짜 오랜만에 너무 깔끔한 고급스러운 노캔 핸드폰이 나와서 너무 마음에 듭니다 이거 또 하나의 차이점이 우리 통화 녹금 할 때 있잖아요 테스트할 때 보니까 통화할 때 QC 45는 화이트 노이즈가 좀 들렸는데 울트라는 화이트 노이즈가 통화할 때 안 들리더라고요 그런 차이점도 있어요 근데 마이크 성능만 조금만 더 좋아졌으면 하는 아쉬움이 \n",

      "현재 토트넘의 분위기가 심상치 않습니다 여러가지 악재가 쌓이고 쌓여 폭발하기 직전입니다 이런 상황에서 히샬리송의 작심 발언마저 터지고 말았습니다 대체 무슨 일이 벌어지고 있는 건지 생생큐브에서 자세한 소식 전해드리겠습니다 대한민국의 손흥민 선수 최근 유력 축구 언론들은 손흥민에게 이런 수식어를 붙였습니다 세계 최고의 선수를 가리는 발롱도르 시비리의 당당히 이름을 올리면서 아시아 선수 역대 최고 기록을 갱신한 프리미어리그의 레전드라고 말입니다 하지만 이런 수식어가 무색하게도 토트넘 내부 상황은 최악을 향해 달리고 있습니다 토트넘은 곧 뉴캐슬과 대결을 펼치게 되는데 리그 최소 시점을 기록하며 6경기째 무패 행진을 달리고 있는 뉴캐슬을 상대로 제대로 된 경기를 펼칠 수 있을지 걱정이 될 정도입니다 손흥민은 직전 경기인 맨체스터 유나이티드전에서 단 한 차례의 슈팅을 기록하며 아쉬운 경기를 치렀고 뉴캐슬 전 득점을 통해 자존심을 되찾고자 합니다 프리미어리그 통산 96골을 기록 중인 손흥민은 백골을 향한 득점포 재가동에 나서고 지난 9월 레스터 해트트릭 이후 리그 4경기 동안 득점을 올리지 못하고 있는 손흥민은 이번 홈경기에서 골 감각을 끌어올리기 위해 벼르고 있을 것입니다 토트넘은 신기하게 팀 성적은 좋습니다 토트넘은 메뉴한테 거의 산산조각이 나며 자존심을 구겼으나 3위를 지키는 데는 성공했습니다 하지만 첼시와 맨유 뉴캐슬의 바짝 추격을 당하고 있는만큼 승리를 통한 상위권 유지에 신경써야 할 상황이고 3위의 경기력을 보여주지 못하고 있다는 것에 주목해야 합니다 대양 쿨루셉스키와 히샬리송이 부상으로 출전이 어려워 결국 득점을 통한 토트넘의 승리를 위해서는 송캐디오 손흥민과 해리 케인이 나서야 합니다 토트넘이 반등하기 위해서는 수비 안정도 중요하지만 무엇보다 공격에 파괴력이 필요합니다 토트넘은 올 시즌 모든 대회를 통틀어 15경기에서 16골을 내주는 불안한 수비에도 불구하고 좋은 성적을 유지할 수 있었던 것은 그나마 공격진이 잘했기 때문인데 최근 이상한 전술 때문에 공격력이 다시 시들고 있습니다 토트넘 공격이 힘을 내기 위해서는 손흥민의 활약이 절실하고 바꿔 말하면 콘테가 정신을 차려야 합니다 지난 시즌 epl에서 23골을 터뜨리며 득점왕에 올랐던 손흥민은 계속 동료들로부터 지원을 받지 못하면서 고립되고 있습니다 오죽하면 국내 매체뿐 아니라 영국 더미러 메트로 스포츠몰 스포츠 바이블 등 일련의 매체들이 손흥민의 희생을 대서특필하고 있고 프리미어리그 레전드들은 하나같이 손흥민을 응원하고 있습니다 풋볼데일리가 올린 EPL 레전드들의 손흥민 오모바라는 내 시간만에 수십만 뷰를 돌파했고 팬들의 뜨거운 관심을 반영했습니다 팬들은 해당 영상과 기사 아래 손흥민과 헤리케인은 토트넘을 떠나야 한다 토트넘은 콘테를 경지라고 새로운 감독을 데려와야 한다 콘텐츠 경기를 포기했고 이미 트로피를 들어올릴 멘탈이 없음을 보여준 것이다 이번 시즌 최악의 결정 중 하나였다 손흥민이 토트넘을 떠날 수도 있을 것 같다는 생각이 든다 한 번도 우승하지 못하고 떠나게 되면 실망스러울 것이다 그의 커리어를 토트넘에서 낭비했다는 생각에 가슴이 아프다 케인과 손흥민은 더 좋은 팀에 갈 수 있는데도 여전히 토트넘에 있다 등의 댓글을 쏟아냈습니다 손흥민 희생당하고 있는 것에 분노를 느끼고 있는 것은 팬들뿐만이 아닙니다 영혼의 파트너인 케인도 그리고 최근에는 히샬리송까지도 강한 분노를 느끼고 있다는 소식이 전해지고 있습니다 손흥민의 빅 팬이라고 밝히기도 한 히샬리송은 토트넘에 올 때부터 손흥민에게 모든 존중을 보냈습니다 둘은 경쟁관계에 놓여 있는데도 불구하고 손흥민이 레스터시티점 부활에 신호탄을 썼을 때 히샬리송은 경쟁상대인 손흥민의 진심으로 축하하는 모습을 보여줬습니다 히샬리송은 같은 날 자신의 sns에 소니의 해트트릭 내 형제 정말 축하해라고 적은 게시물을 올렸고 손흥민에게 직접 사인을 받은 유니폼도 함께 올릴 정도였습니다 손흥민 역시 히샬리송을 잇는 그대로 존중했습니다 생애 처음으로 히샬리송이 챔피언스리그에서 멀티골을 뽑아내고 눈물까지 보였을 때 손흥민은 자신의 sns에 특별한 선수 히샬리송을 위한 특별한 밤 엄청난 분위기였습니다라며 히샬리송을 진심으로 축하하는 글을 올린 적이 있습니다 이처럼 두 선수는 서로의 성품과 실력을 존중하고 손 경쟁은 항상 좋다 경쟁은 나뿐만 아니라 팀 동료들도 향상시킨다 히샬리송과 같은 선수를 영입한 건 대단한 일이다 히샬리송은 훌륭한 선수이기엔 난 그의 영입을 반긴다 같이 생활한지 얼마되지 않았지만 정말 친한 친구 사이가 됐다라고 밝혔습니다 하지만 히샬리송은 현재 토트넘에서 수비하는 손흥민의 모습을 보며 충격에 빠졌습니다 토트넘 내부 관계자에 의하면 히샬리송이 토트넘으로 이적을 결심한 가장 큰 이유는 챔피언스리그에 진출하는 것과 프리미어리그 최고의 공격진으로 평가받던 게임과 손흥민 함께 뛰는 것 때문이었는데 콘테가 손흥민 희생을 강요하고 공격진영에서 손흥민과 제대로 된 호흡을 맞추기 어려운이 상황에 분노를 표출한 것으로 알려진 것입니다 특히 히샬리송은 자신이 존경하는 손흥민이 경기 내내 고립되고 비정상적인 수비가담을 하는 것을 보면서 벤치에서 오랫동안 고개를 숙이고 있었다는 일화가 전해지기도 했습니다 공격진영에서 손켓 듀오와 호흡을 맞추는 것을 고대하고 토트넘에 왔는데 그에게는 이상과 현실의 괴리가 너무나도 심했던 것입니다 최 그녀의 레전드인 하그리브스는 이런 말을 했습니다 누구나 손흥민 케인과 같이 뛰기 바란다 손흥민과 케인은 프리미어리그 빅6와 맞설 수 있는 토트넘의 유일한 공격진이다 그만큼 손켓이오는 선수들에게도 우상인 존재라는 것입니다 한편 이런 상황에서 다소 충격적인 소식이 전해졌는데요 콘테 감독이 재계약을 미루는 이유가 예산 우려 때문이라는 것입니다 영국 풋볼 인사이더는 바로 오늘인 23일 콘택 감독은 이적 예산에 대한 우려 때문에 토트넘에서 새로운 계약을 체결하지 않고 있다라고 전했습니다 콘테 감독은 지난해 11월 토트넘 감독직에 부임했습니다 시즌 도중 부임이었음에도 불구하고 곧바로 팀을 변화시켰습니다 토트넘은 성적이 좋아지면서 순위가 수직 상승했고 경기력 측면에서도 상대를 압도했습니다 결국 목표였던 챔피언스리그 진출권을 획득하는 데에도 성공했습니다 콘테 감독이 토트넘에서 성공가도를 달리고 있지만 팬들은 한 가지가 불안했습니다 바로 그의 계약 기간입니다 당초 콘테 감독은 부임 당시 연장 옵션이 포함되어 있지만 2023년 6월까지 동행을 약속했습니다 즉 계약기간은 올 시즌까지이고 여기에 최근 유벤투스와도 연결되면서 팬들의 불안감은 더 커졌습니다 하지만 영국 풋볼 런던의 알렉스 대학 골드 기자는 1년 연장 옵션이 가능하다고 밝혔습니다 그는 지난 23일 콘택 감독의 계약은 이번 시즌이 끝난 내년 여름이다 하지만 계약을 연장할 수 있는 옵션이 있다 또한이 옵션은 쌍병약 옵션이라는 것인데이는 양 당사자가 연장에 동의해야 한다는 의미다 그러나 토트넘이 선택권을 쥐고 있고 구단은 언제든지 옵션을 발동할 수 있다라고 설명했습니다 즉 토트넘은 원한다면 언제든지 콘택 감독과 1년 재계약을 맺을 수 있다는 의미입니다 만약 토트넘이 계약 연장 옵션을 발동하게 된다면 콘테 감독은 토트넘과 2024년 여름까지 계약 기간이 연장됩니다 토트넘 관계자인 맥매너스는 떠나려는 콘테가 이적의 산 지원을 약속받으면 재계약을 맺을 것이라고 확신했습니다 그는 풋볼 인사이더와의 인터뷰에서 나는 그가 저녁 시장에서 강한 지질을 받고 싶어할 것이라고 생각한다 그들은 예상과 실제 지출할 수 있는 금액 면에서 콘테가 원하는 자금을 조달해야 한다 콘테 감독은 내년 여름 그들이 큰돈을 쓸 것이라는 보장을 내비 회장으로부터 원할 것라고 주장했습니다 이어 최고의 선수들을 영입하기 위해 그 팀에 1억 5천만 파운드 2억 파운드를 써야 한다 나는 그가 그 보장을 받는다면 재계약의 서명할 것이라고 생각한다 나는 콘테 감독이 재계약에 서명하지 않는 이유가 이적 자금에 대해 확신하지 못하기 때문이라고 생각한다 아마도 그는 그의 선수단 깊숙한 곳에서 약간 좌절하고 있는 것 같다라고 덧붙였습니다 내용은 이렇지만 일각에서는 작은 문제는 핑계에 불과하다면서 오히려 콘테가 큰 그림을 그리고 있는 것이 아니냐는 의문을 제기했는데요 어떤 팬들은 차라리 손흥민을 희생시키는 콘테가 떠났으면 좋겠다고 말하기도 했습니다 과연 토트넘의 운명은 어떻게 될까요 생생 튜브 영상 여기서 마치겠습니다 영상 시청해주신 분들께 진심으로 감사한다는 말씀 전하며 이만 물러나 겠습니다 감사합니다 \n",

      " 일본의 수도인 도쿄가 물에 잠길 수 있다는 우려가 있다며 높이 10m에 육박하는 방파제를 건설하고 있어 일본에서 매우 큰 논란이 되고 있습니다 그 길이만 해도 무려 60km의 달할 정도로 거대하다고 하는데요 일본인들은 이처럼 거대한 방파제를 보며 거대한 바벨탑을 만들어 결국 멸망의 이름 바빌론 프로젝트 같다고 우려하고 있습니다 이제 일본 역시 본격적으로 물바다가 될 직접적인 위험에 처한 것으로 보입니다 어떠한 소식인지 자세히 살펴보겠습니다 일본이 올해에도 어김없이 온난화 대책의 가장 뒤쳐진 국가에게 주어지는 화석상을 2022년 11월 9일에 수상해 불명예를 떠안게 되었습니다 환경단체 ngo의 국제네트워크인 기후행 동네트워크가 일본이 기후 온난화 발생원인에 대해서 가장 책임이 있는 일이 국가로 선정되었다면서 강도 높게 비판했습니다 최근 기후위기로 인해 전 세계가 태풍과 폭우 등 기상위변이 자주 발생하고 있습니다 그리고 그 피해가 가장 큰 국가 중 하나 바로 일본입니다 일본은 지난 10여년간 단 며칠 만에 1000mm가 쏟아지는 폭우가 자주 발생하고 태풍이 연이어 강타하는 등 기우재난의 초토화가 되고 있습니다 올해에만 해도 일본의 초강력 태풍과 폭우가 여러 차례 발생했고 그로 인해 일본인들이 큰 고통을 겪고 있습니다 그러나 일본 정부는 기상위변에 근본적인 원인이 되고 있는 화석연료 사용에 대해서는 거의 방치하고 있어 일본 우량한 비판이 거세지고 있는데요 일본 정부가 화석상을 수상한 근거가 있습니다 미국 ngo인 오일 체인지 인터내셔널 보고서에 따르면 일본 정부가 국제협력 은행이나 투자은행과 함께 석탄이나 석유 그리고 천연가스 사업에 투자한 금액이 2019년부터 2021년까지 연평균으로 106억 달러 원화로 무려 15조원에 달했다는 것입니다 기우재난을 직접적으로 경험하고 있는 일본이지만 이러한 화석연료에 대한 비중은 거의 줄이지 않고 있습니다 일본이 화석상을 수상 것은 3회 연속으로 불명예스러운 수상이 되고 있습니다 이에 대해서 일본 언론마저도 불명예스러운 결과라고 한탄하고 있는데요 물론 캐나다와 미국 그리고 한국과 중국도 화석연료에 대한 투자가 많은 편이긴 하지만 일본을 넘어서기 힘들었는데요 따라서 전 세계가 기상위변에 대처하기 위해서 변화를 시도하고 있지만 일본만 거의 유일하게 오히려 시대의 역행하고 있다고 전 세계 경제 전문가와 NGO 단체가 비판하고 있습니다 물론 이에 대해서 중국과 관련된 정보를 믿기 어렵다는 주장도 제기되고 있습니다 따라서 만약 중국 정부가 제대로 된 정보를 공개했다면 중국이 일본을 제치고 화석상을 받았을 가능성이 높다는 주장이 나오고 있습니다 그러나 5일 체인지 인터내셔널 ngo가 중국에 대해서 이러한 사항에 대해서 직접적으로 조사할 권한이 없기 때문에 중국 순위는 예상보다 순위가 낮은 편으로 보입니다 그리고 일본이 지속적으로 화석상을 받을 수밖에 없는 이유가 있습니다 cop27 즉 기후변화협 지구온난화를 방지하기 위해 온실가스를 인위적으로 방출하기 위한 협약을 뜻합니다 일본이 지속적으로 화석상을 받을 수밖에 없는 이유가 있는데요 일본 정부의 방침이 기후변화협약과 완전히 상반되기 때문입니다 기후변화협약에 가장 핵심적인 과제는 석탄화력의 단계적 폐지입니다 그러나 일본은 2030년 이후에도 석탄을 지속적으로 사용할 계획입니다 세계 국가의 노선과 일본의 노선은 완전히 상반된 태도를 보이고 있는데요 지난해 열린 기후변화 협력에서 대한민국뿐만 아니라 46개 국가의 지역이 석탄 화력발전에 대해서 단계적 폐지를 선언하고 지지를 표명했습니다 그러나 일본은 석탄발전이 무려 30%에 달할 정도로 비중이 매우 높음에도 불구하고 여전히 석탄 발전과 관련된 폐지 계획이 없는 상태입니다 이러한 것을 보면 일본 정부의 무책임한 태도를 엿볼 수가 있는데요 그러나 일본 정부가 3회 연속으로 화석상을 수상한 상황에 대해서 일본인들은 정말 황당한 반응을 보이고 있어 논란이 되고 있습니다 정말 이해할 수 없을 정도인데요 영예로운 상입니다 일본 정부가 올바른 에너지 정책을 실행하고 있다는 증거입니다 기후변화가 인위적으로 변한다는 학설은 명백한 허위이자 가짜 과학입니다 이것은 사실 명예로운 일이 아닐까요 화석상을 받을 수 있다는 것은 일본의 탈탄소와 기술의 정당성이 증명된 증거라고 할 수 있습니다 이것은 일본을 위한 상이군요 영광스러운 일입니다 이제 일본은 당당하게 석유와 석탄을 쓸 수 있습니다라는 등 많은 일본인들이 상당히 비상식적인 반응을 보이고 있어 논란이 되고 있습니다 이처럼 일본인들 중에서 상식적이지 않은 반응들이 너무 많아 황당할 정도였는데요 기시다 일본 총리가 왜 기후변화에 대해서 거의 신경을 쓰지 않은지 알 수 있는 대목이었습니다 일본 총리뿐만 아니라 일본인들 역시 지구 온난화에 대해서는 매우 무관심할뿐만 아니라 오히려 화석연료를 사용하는 것을 자랑스러워하는 반응들이 많이 보였습니다 그러나 지구 온난화로 인한 피해를 고스란히 보는 국가 역시 일본으로 보입니다 일본은 섬나라이기 때문에 바다의 영향을 많이 받고 있으며 최근에 태풍과 폭우로 가장 많이 피해를 보는 국가 중 하나입니다 그러한 사례로 일본은 봄부터 가을까지 폭우가 반복되고 있습니다 그리고 일본의 수도인 도쿄 앞에 도쿄만이 있어 더욱 위험하다는 분석이 나오고 있습니다 만약 도쿄만이 태풍이나 해일에 의해서 바닷물이 넘치게 된다면 도쿄가 매우 큰 피해를 볼 수밖에 없다고 일본 정부가 매우 우려하고 있는데요 따라서 일본 정부는 도쿄를 방어하기 위해서 거대한 방조제를 건설하고 있었습니다 그런데 일본 정부가 2022년 11월 10일에 발표한 자료에 따르면 이처럼 거대한 방조제의 높이가 났다고 판단해 더욱 방조제의 높이를 높이는 계획안을 발표한 것입니다 지구온난화가 급격히 진행됨에 따라 일본 앞바다의 해수면이 예상보다 빠르게 상승할뿐만 아니라 초강력 태풍이 자주 발생할 것으로 전망에 초기 방조제 계획안을 수정할 수밖에 없었다고 일본 정부가 밝혔습니다 도쿄도에 따르면 지금까지 도쿄왕 연안에 높이가 최대 8m에 달하며 무려 60km에 달하는 방조제를 설치하고 있었습니다 그런데 2022년 11월 10일에 계획이 변경되어 최대 1.4m까지 더 올리는 계획안이 발표되었습니다 따라서 변경된 계획안에 따라 도쿄형 연안에 최대 높이 9.4m에 길이가 60km에 달하는 거대한 방조제가 설치될 것으로 보입니다 그리고 상황에 따라 해수면에 온도가 더욱 상승할 우려도 있으며 초강력 태풍이 자주 발생할 우려도 있기 때문에 10년마다 계획을 재검토해 방조제를 더욱 높일 수도 있다고 일본 정부는 밝혔습니다 또한 일본 정부에 따르면 폭우와 태풍으로 인해 강수량이 급증할 것으로 보여 도쿄의 배수가 원활하지 못해 침수될 우려가 증가함에 따라 배수펌프를 더욱 많이 설치하는 등 배수능력 향상도 계획하고 있다고 도쿄도는 밝혔습니다 그러나 대해서 일본인들은 최대 높이 9.4m에 길이가 60km에 달하는 거대한 방조제 계획안을 보며 마치 바벨탑으로 멸망한 바빌론 프로젝트 같다라고 우려하기도 했습니다 국제연구팀에 따르면 석탄과 석유 등 화석연료에서 유래하는 2022년 세계 이산화탄소 배출량은 375억 톤의 달할 것으로 추정했습니다 지난해보다 1% 늘어난 수치인데 역대 최대가 되는 것입니다 국제연구팀에 따르면 이러한 원인으로 감염이 줄어 산업이 활성화되는 동시에 세계 각국의 관광 수요가 늘어 항공업계가 되살아나는 영향이 크다고 밝히고 있습니다 2015년 프랑스 파리에서 열린 20일차 기후변화 당사국 총회에서는 세계 각국이 산업화 이전 수준 대비 기온상승을 2도로 제한하는 방안 특히 1.5도 이내로 제한하기 위해서 노력하자는 목표를 세웠습니다 따라서 세계 각국은 온실가스를 감축하기 위해서 노력하고 있습니다 그러나 세계 각국의 노력에도 불구하고 1.5도 이내로 제한하자는 목 달성하기 어려울 것으로 보입니다 특히 일본이 기후 위기를 조장하는 온실가스 배출에 가장 합장 서고 있는 것으로 보입니다 그리고 그러한 피해는 일본에게 직접적으로 영향을 끼칠 것으로 보입니다 이처럼 일본의 어처구니없는 태도에 대해서 어떻게 생각하시나요 오늘 준비한 영상은 여기까지입니다 구독과 좋아요 알림 설정까지 부탁드립니다 \n",

      "우리 주둥이 분들은 뭘 궁금해할까 궁금증 해결 한번 해 줘야지 하이 빅스비 앞으로 남북 관계와 국제 정세는 어떻게 될지 올래 총선의 향방은 어떻게 될지 알고 싶어 적절한 답이 떠오르지 않네요 견디고 듣다 보면 늘어가는 테크지식 오케이 안녕하세요 여러분 주연입니다 자 이번 갤럭시 s24 시리즈 저는 지금 며칠 동안 써보고 있는데요 이번 갤럭시 어떠냐고 막 친구들이 많이 물어봤는데 이번에 진짜 예쁘게 나왔어 그리고 다음으로 한 얘기가 AI 기능 이번에 미쳤다 진짜 꼭 써 봐라 그다음에 세 번째로 했던 얘기가 뭐냐면 나 이번에는 울트라 사고 싶더라라는 말이었어요 왜냐면 일단 울트라가 뭐 늘 이렇게 크게 나오지만 제 손에는 사실 좀 버겁긴 해요 그냥 주머니에 넣고 다니는 것도 좀 버겁고 무게도 좀 그렇고 그래서 항상 울트라는 참 가지고 있으면 편하고 좋긴 하겠지만 메인폰으로 쓰기에는 너무 버겁다 이런 생각이 항상 있었는데 현장에서 본 첫날 삼성이 이번에 울트라를 정말 일을 갈고 만들었구나 정말 신경을 많이 썼구나 이런 느낌이 딱 들어 가지고 난 이번에 울트라 살 거야 이러고 사전 예약 열리자마자 울트라를 샀어요 근데 여러분 제가 좀 더 써 보면서 좀 더 이렇게 고심 고심을 해보면서 특히 이번에 구매 가이드를 여러분한테 알려 드리려고 막 이렇게 원고를 쓰던 도중에 메인 폰에 대한 마음이 바뀌었습니다 도대체 제가 왜 마음을 바꾼 건지 어떤 모델을 구매한 건지 오늘 영상 끝까지 보시면 여러분들도 마음 아마 정하실 수 있을 거예요 지금부터 한번 시작해 볼게요 렛츠고 자 이번 갤럭시 S 24는 울트라 플러스 일반 이렇게 세 종류로 나왔어요 늘 그랬던 것처럼 똑같이 나왔죠 그런데 이전 23까지 일반이랑 플러스 모델이 크기 차이 말고는 별 차이가 없었어요 그래서 그냥 더 작은 거 쓰고 싶은 사람 가벼운 거 쓰고 싶은 사람은 일반을 썼으면 됐습니다 그래서 저도 전작에서는 23 일반이랑 울트라를 구매를 했어요 근데 이번엔 좀 다르더라고요 일반과 플러스의 끝 차이가 있고요 또 플러스와 울트라에도 급차이가 있습니다 그래서 지금이 세 모델 중에서 고민하고 계시는 분들이라면 오늘 영상 도움이 많이 될 거예요 커뮤니티에 여러분한테 질문을 받았는데 질문에 대한 답변도 한번 드리도록 하겠습니다 일단 주연 님의 개인적인 컬러 추천 제가 그 자리에서도 뭐 자세하게 보여 드리기는 했습니다만 이번에는 울트라랑 일반 플러스 색상이 다르게 나왔어요 그래서 일반 플러스는 색상이 똑같고 울트라만 이제 티타늄 색상들로 이렇게 나와 있는데 알루미늄이라 티타늄이 둘 다 무광 소재라서 비슷하지 않을까 이렇게 예상했었는데 실제로 보니까 느낌이 많이 다르긴 하더라고요 그래서 플러스랑 일반은 측면이 알루미늄으로 들어가 있고 울트라는 이렇게 티타늄 소재로 들어가 있어서 약간 티타늄 소재가 조금 더 묵직한 느낌이 들면서 색상은 조금 더 차분한 느낌 그런 느낌이고 일반이랑 플러스가 울트라보너스 색상은 일곱 가지가 있는데 티타늄 블루 티타늄 그린 티타늄 오렌지라고 해가지고 삼성 닷컴 그리고 삼성 강남점에서만 볼 수 있는 세 가지 색상이 있어요 얘네들은 특징이 겉에 프레임이 어두운 그레이 티타늄으로 돼 있더라고요 그래서 그거를 좀 참고하시면 좋을 거 같고 수면 컬러가 하늘색 연두색 주황색 이렇게 돼 있는데 그 짤이 돌더라고요 꼬북이 파일이 이상해씨 이렇게 해가지고 그 포켓몬을 형상화한 거 같다고 그자를 보고 좀 호감이 생겼어요 컬러 말고 기본적으로는 요렇게네 가지가 있어요 티타늄 그레이티 티타늄 블랙 티타늄 바이올렛 티타늄 옐로우가 있고 저는 개인적으로 티타늄 바이올렛이 옆에 프레임은 은색이고이 카메라 링도 은색이고 그게 독특해 보여서 티타늄 바이올렛이 제일 마음에 들었거든요 근데 또 이게 호불호가 갈리더라고요 그럴 거라고 예상은 했어요 그다음에 제가 지금 가지고 있는게 티타늄 그레이 색상이에요이 취재 현장에서 좀 노란 조명이 있어 가지고 좀 살짝 노랗게 나왔더라고요 근데 이게 실제로 보면은 노란기가 막 많이 돌지는 않고 약간 이제 반사될 때 반짝반짝거리는 이런 느낌이 있어요 그래서 되게 생각보다 굉장히 예쁩니다 이거 제가 꼭 한번 비교해 드리고 싶었던게 제가 아이폰 15 프도 내추럴 티타늄 색상으로 샀거든요 s24 울트라의 색상이 좀 더 티타늄의 광물 느낌이 나고 아이폰은 조금 오히려 실버 그레이에 더 가까운 느낌 이런 차이가 좀 느껴지긴 하더라고요 자 그런데 진짜 실버 그레이 같은 느낌은 바로 요거요 일반이랑 플러스의 마블 그레이 색상 하향에 가까 아주 밝은 그레이톤의 후면이 옆에 측면을 보시면 그냥 실버예술단게이 프레임 이렇게 보이는 거 한 줄 얇게 싹 보이는이 프레임이 너무 예쁜 거예요 이게 빛에 반사되면 진짜 막 실버 색상으로 반짝반짝 거리는데 너무 예쁘더라고요 그래서 개인적으로 전 모델 중에서 제일 예쁜 색상은 이거 같아요 마블 그레이 그다음에 울트라 컬러의 티타늄 블랙이 있는데요 티타늄 블랙이 제 주변에선 제일 인기가 많 더라고요 실물로 딱 봤을 때 그 애플의 스페이스 그레이 있잖아요 스페이스 그레이에 블랙을 살짝 더 탄 느낌에 엄청 고급스러운 색상이어서 고급스러운 느낌 좋아하시는 분들이라면 호부로 안 갈리고 다 좋아할 법한 그런 색상 그다음에 티타늄 옐로우가 있는데 골드라고 하기에는 조금 특이한 그런 옐로우 색상인데 사실 제 취향은 아니었습니다 그리고 일반이랑 플러스 색상 보시면은 사파이어 블루 제이드 그린 샌드스톤 오렌지 해가지고 얘네도 그 포켓몬 시리즈가 있어요 사실 이번에 디자인이 좀 많이 바뀌었어 어요 24 시리즈가 23 시리즈랑 같이 놓고 보면은 울트라도 지금 그냥 이렇게만 보면은 비슷해 보이지만 일단은 옆에 측면도 엣지 디스플레이서 완전 플랫 디스플레이로 변경이 돼서 손에 쥐었을 때 느낌도 많이 달라졌고요 옆에 측면 프레임도 유광에서 무광으로 바뀌어서 느낌이 많이 달라졌어요 그리고 사실 저는 진짜 마음에 들었던게 스피커 디자인이 달라졌는데요 전장은 막 이렇게 구멍이 뿅뿅뿅뿅 뚫려 있는 디자인이었는데 이번에는 그냥 한 줄로 쭉 요렇게 돼 있는 심플한 디자인으로 바뀌었어요 그래서 저는 이게 훨씬 더 깔끔하고 예쁘더라고요 그리고 소재에는 티타늄이 적용이 됐죠 그래서 기존 알루미늄보다 더 튼튼하고 좀 고급스러워졌습니다 아이폰 시리즈에서 티타늄이 적용될 때는 무게가 좀 많이 줄었어요 10몇 그램인가 줄어들었는데 그 이유는 전작은 프로와 프로 맥스의 스테인레스를 썼기 때문에 지금 아이폰 15 시리즈에 들어간 알루미늄 티타늄 합금 소재가 무게가 더 가볍기 때문에 무게가 줄어든 거고요 갤럭시 같은 경우에는 항상 알루미늄이 들어갔어요 알루미늄이 티타늄이 비교하면 사실은 티타늄이 더 무거운 소재예요 그래서 오히려 무게는 1g 가벼워졌고 그다음에 저는 사실 일반과 플러스 모델이 진짜 예뻐졌다고 생각이 드는게 카메라만 가려면은 아이폰인가 이런 느낌 들 정도로 아이폰 12 시리즈랑 프레임이 거의 비슷해요 이런 완전 딱 깎여 나가 있는 는 깻잎통 디자인으로 되어 있고 그래서 손에 딱 쥐었을 때 느낌도 많이 다르더라고요 그래서 이번 디자인이 되게 마음에 들었고 일반 플러스 모델도 스피커가 요런 식으로 변경이 됐습니다 자 그리고 갤럭시 S 24에서 전작과 또 다른 점이 바로 디스플레이에 플러스랑 일반 모델 같은 경우에는 전작보다 0.1in 더 커졌고요 울트라는 오히려 0.02 in 더 작아졌어요 지난번 영상에서도 한번 언급해 드리긴 했는데 전작에서는 위아래 불균형 베젤이 있었던게 이번에는 위아래 균형도 맞춰 졌고요 베젤도 조금 더 줄어들었습니다 그래서 굉장히 넓은 화면으로 볼 수 있는 데다가 플랫해서 가지고 저는 정말 마음에 들었고요 그리고 사실 진짜 이번 울트라에서 너무 마음에 들었던게 디스플레이에 새로운 소재가 들어갔거든요 코닝 고릴라글래스 중에 암머 제품이 들어갔는데 바로 비교를 해보면 여러분 보이세요 얘는 이렇게 반사가 심한데 얘는 거의 안 보여요 보이세요 같은 위치에서 바꿔서 해도이 정도의 차이예요 진짜 비반 사유를 확 줄여 가지고 그냥 눈으로 봤을 때 훨씬 눈이 편합니다 둘 다 보호필름 안 붙인 상태인데이 정도의 차이가납니다 그냥 육안으로 딱 보이니까 너무 마음에 드는 거예요 그다음에 최대 밝기도 변경이 됐어요 전작은 모두 1750 니트가 최대 발기했는데 이번 s24 시리즈는 모두 최대 밝기가 2,600 니트로 굉장히 더 밝아졌습니다 사실 요거는 지금 이렇게 설정해서 최대 밝기를 해 놓는 거는 진짜이 스마트폰의 최대 밝기가 아닙니다 이게 갤럭시에 있는 조도 센서로 진짜 막 밝은 빛이 내리 째면 점점 더더더 밝기를 높여서 최대 밝기가 나오는 거거든요 그래서 2,600 니트까지 올라간 이걸 경험하시면 진짜 한 여름에 막 내일 째는 태양 아래에서 핸드폰을 하는 경우 혹은 엄청나게 밝은 조명 아래에서 핸드폰을 보는 경우 요럴 때 확실히 전작보다 시인성이 훨씬 더 높아지고 뛰어나진 거를 아마 확인하실 수 있을 거예요 그리고 해상도는 이번 s24 일반 형에서는 차이가 없는데요 플러스 모델이 업그레이드 가 있어요 그러니까 여기서 또 일반 모델과 플러스 모델의 끝 차이가 나오는 건데요 일반 모델은 해상도가 풀 HD 플인데 플러스는 QHD 플러스로 업그레이드가 됐습니다 그리고 울트라 모델은 QHD 플러스의 이제 플랫 디스플레이로 들어가 있고요 주목해야 될 점은 일반형과 플러스형 둘 다 가격이 그대로 동결인 플러스 형만 QHD 플러스로 업데이트가 됐다는 거예요 그러니까 가격이 그대로 동결인 업그레이드가 얘만 되고 얘는 안 됐다 그러니까 지금 일반형은 좀 성비가 안 좋게 느껴지고 오히려 플러스가 더 좋게 느껴지는 그런 상황인 거죠 또 램도 비교해 보면 24 시리즈에서 일반형 man 램이 8gb 나머지 둘은 12gb 그래요 그래서 이번에 또 무슨 얘기가 있냐면 사실 이번 갤럭시 s24 시리즈에서 가장 기대되는 부분은 인공지능 기능이자아요 AI 기능들이 새롭게 여러 가지가 추가가 되고 또 온 디바이스로 처리될 수 있는 AI 기능들 뭐 실시간 통 력 기능 이미지 생성 기능 뭐 이런 것들이 다양하게 들어갔는데 제가 지난번 영상에서도 한번 보여 드렸잖아요 진짜이 AI 기능들에 대한 반응이 뜨겁더라구요 와 진짜 지금까지의 AI 기능들은 뭔가 그냥 홍보를 위해서 들어간 어떤 수단 같은 느낌이었다면 진짜 이번에 들어간 AI 기능들은 실제로 많이 유용하게 쓰일 거 같다 이런 반응들이 많았는데요 확실히 제 머리색 다음으로 화제가 됐던 거 같습니다 그런데이 세 가지 모델 중에 고민 중이시라면 사실은이 새로운 AI 기능들 이 세 가지 모델에 다 동일하게 적용이 됩니다 하지만 이런 차이는 있습니다이 램 용량의 차이가 있다고 말씀드렸잖아요 아무래도 AI 기능 활용할 때 데이터 처리 속도에 차이가 있을 수밖에 없어요 왜냐면 제가 삼성전자 반도체 채널에서 반도체 관련 컨텐츠들을 진행하고 있는데 최근에 딱 mpu 관련 영상을  찍었어요 그래서 그때 이제 mpu 개발 부서에 계시는 분이랑 얘기 를 나눴는데 AI 기능에 기본적으로 실행을 할 때 데이터가 한 번에 엄청나게 많이 들어갑니다 그래서이 많은 데이터를 한꺼번에 처리를 하기 위해서 이거에 특화된 부품이 바로 npu 아는 거고 이제 그만큼 한 번에 데이터를 많이 처리해야 되기 때문에 램 용량이 또 많을수록 유리할 수밖에 없는 거죠 그래서 아무래도 일반형 모델에 들어간 8gb 램이 다른 모델들에 들어간 12gb 램보다 부족하게 느껴질 수밖에 없지 않느냐 이제 이런 이야기도 나오고 있는 겁니다 그리고 더불어서 최근에 삼성전자가 os 업데이트 주기를 더 늘렸어요 한 번 구입했을 때 조금 더 오랫동안 핸드폰을 사용할 예정이시라면 앞으로는 또 AI 기능들을 더 많이 활용하게 될 수도 있잖아요 그래서 좀 더 넉넉한 램 용량을 가지고 있는 제품들로 구입을 하시는게 오래 쓸 때 좋지 않을까라는 생각도 듭니다 다만 저도 궁금했어요 정말로 랩 용량 차이에 따라서 AI 기능 처리에 뭔가 차이가 있을까 그래서 생성형 AI 두 개의 폰에서 돌려봤습니다이 생성형 AI 쓰려면이 이 갤럭시 AI 버튼을 눌러서 여기서 제가 이렇게 마우스를 동그랗게 선택을 하면 자동으로이 물체를 인식을 해요 그래서 마우스나 딱 선택이 됩니다 요거를 다른 장소로 이동을 해 봤어요 다른 곳으로 이동을 했고 이제 자동으로이 마우스가 비워진 부분을 채워 줄 건데요 이게 생성형 AI 해 주는 기능 중에 하나고요 기다려 보시면 플러스에서는 짜잔 최대한 자연스럽게 이게 맥북 위에 마우스가 올려져 있던 거였거든요이 트랙패드 부분에 약간 그림자 같은 게 생기긴 했지만 그래도 마치 원래의 맥북 모습처럼 배경을 복원을 해 줬어요 그런데 일반형에서 진행한 모습을 보시면 마우스를 다른 곳에 옮기자 여기에 이상한 무슨 까만 물체 같은게 생겼어요 뭐 때문에 이런 까만 색깔 동그란 물체가 생겼는지는 모르겠지만 원래의 그 노트북 트랙패드 쪽에 올려져 있는 거라고는 상상하기 힘든 그런 이미지가 생겨 버려서 배경 생성 기능만 놓고 봤을 때는 일반형의 생성형 AI 기능이 약간 아쉬움이 있었습니다 그리고 다른 사진으로도 시도를 해봤는데요 먹다남은 과자 봉지 하나를 이렇게 눕기를 따서 옮겨 봤을 때 기본형은 봉지 색깔을 따라 그리지 못했는데 플러스는 봉지랑 똑같은 모양으로 생성을 하더라고요 그래서 이렇게 두 사진으로 간략하게 실험을 해 봤을 때 생성형 AI 사용시에는 색깔을 더 잘 구현하거나 이미지를 좀 더 자연스럽게 생성하는 결과가 있긴 했습니다 약간의 이렇게 차이가 있다는 거를 저는 실감을 했기 때문에 플러스 쪽으로 혹은 울트라 쪽으로 추천을 드리고 싶어요 하지만 또 세 모델 다 똑같이 업그레이드가 된 부분도 있는데요 바로 가변 주사율 있니다 원래는 울트라 모델만 1에서 120hz 가변 주사율이 있는데 기본형 플러스 울트라 전부 다 1에서 120hz 가변 주사율을 지원합니다 그래서 화면 주사율에 있어서는 셋다 동일한 스펙을 가지고 있고요 일반형을 사실 분들은 이미 정해진 거 같고 플러스와 울트라를 고민할 때는 카메라가 제일 큰 요소죠 아무래도 울트라가 플러스에 비해 진짜 확실하게 좋은 점이 있다면 카메라이기 때문에 카메라 비교도 한번 해 봤습니다 울트라 카메라의 전작 s23 울트라와 2번 s24 울트라 카메라 비교는 제가 이전 영상에 한번 이미 올려 드렸기 때문에 좀 더 자세한 비교를 보시려면 그 영상 참고하시고요 오늘은 플러스와 울트라만 비교를 해 볼게요 일단 3배줌 사진에서는 사실 별 차이가 없어요이 플러스도 3배 광학 줌까지 들어가거든요 그런데 5배줌 10배 줌을 보시면 확실한 차이가 보입니다 울트라가 일단은 색상 표현도 더 잘하고요 어 소위 말하는 트 밸런스도 조금 더 잘 잡아주는 것도 보실 수 있고 특히 하늘이나 건물벽에 노을색이 좀 가장 자연스럽게 나타나는 걸 볼 수가 있어요 이게 확실히 5배줌 10배줌 이렇게 가면 울트라의 진가가 나타나긴 하더라고요 그리고 30배줌이 디지털 줌에서 확실하게 더 차이가납니다 기본과 플러스는 건물 외관의 줄 저 줄 보이시나요 이게 거의 보이지 않는데 울트라는 줄이 선명하게 잘 보이고 간판도이 하나로마트고양점 선명하지 않게 보이는 반면에 울트라에서 확실히 깔끔하게 보이는 걸 확인하실 수 있죠 그리고 색감도 아주 많이 다릅니다 아무래도 좀 망원 카메라를 많이 사용하고 싶다 특히 콘서트에서 직캠 찍고 싶다 혹은 풍경 사진 많이 찍고 싶다 이런 분들은 무조건 울트라로 가셔야 됩니다 카메라에 있어서는 어쩔 수 없이 스펙상의 차이가 있기 때문에 망원 카메라에서 큰 차이가 나더라고 그리고 저조도 사진도 찍어 봤는데요 꽤 차이가 나더라고요 저조도 확실히 빛이 있는 곳에서 촬영을 했을 때는 이제 빛번짐이 좀 에 띄는데요 플러스랑 일반은 5배 줌터 뭉개짐이 많이 심하고요 울트라는 30배 디지털 줌을 해도 저조도 사진이 굉장히 선명하고 나이토 그래피 모드라고 하죠 즉 야간 모드로 촬영된 건물 간판과 표지판의 선명도가 확실하게 좋더라고요 그리고 역시 성능 차이에 대해서 궁금해하시는 분들도 많았는데요 아무래도 이번에는 국내 모델 기준으로 일반 플러스에는 엑시노스 칩셋이 들어갔고 울트라에는 스냅드래곤이 들어갔잖아요 왜 일반과 플러스 울트라 이렇게 칩셋 종류를 나눠 서 넣었을까 벤치를 쫙 돌려봤어요 우선은이 제품은 양산품이 아닌 테스트 제품이기 때문에 실제로 여러분이 받으신 제품이랑은 약간의 그 성능 차이가 있을 수 있고요 긱벤치 테스트는 세 번을 진행을 해 봤습니다 100% 충전한 상태에서 연속으로 진행을 했고요 같은 울트라끼리 엑시노스 모델과 스냅드래곤 모델을 비교해 보면 좋겠지만 사실 플러스와 울트라만 비교를 해도 엑시노스가 생각보다 점수가 꽤 괜찮게 나오더라고요 첫 번째 테스트에서 기본형은 싱글 26점 멀티 6923 플러스는 싱글 2,192 J 멀티 6923 울트라는 싱글 2300점 멀티 745점 기본형의 싱글 멀티 점수는 큰 차이가 없었고요 플러스 울트라에서 싱글과 멀티 둘 다 각각 100점 정도의 차이가 있었습니다 두 번째 테스트에서는 기본형은 싱글 286m 멀티 69점 플러스는 싱글 2148 J 멀티 6879 울트라는 싱글 2237 멀티 6980 J5 두 번째 테스트에서는 기본형과 플러스가 싱글에서는 큰 차이가 없어 는데 멀티 점수에서는 200점 정도 차이가 나더라고요 그리고 두 번째 테스트에서도 플러스와 울트라가 싱글과 멀티 둘 다 100점 정도 차이가 있었습니다 세 번째 테스트에서 기본 모델은 싱글 260점 멀티 6452 플러스는 싱글 26점 멀티는 6768 울트라는 싱글 28점 멀티 6890이 나왔고요 두 번째 테스트 때보다는 플러스와 울트라의 점수 차이가 조금 더 줄어든 거를 보실 수가 있습니다 특히 싱글 점수에서 이전 테스트에서는 100점 정도 차이가 났었는데 세 번째에서는 50점 정도로 차이가 많이 줄었더라 그요 스냅드래곤을 사용하는 울트라 와도 생각보다는 큰 차이가 나진 않더라고요 엑시노스를 이방과 플러스에 넣고 울트라는 스냅드래곤을 쓴 이유가 뭔가 점수 차이가 꽤 나기 때문이 아닐까라고 생각을 했었는데 생각보다는 점수 차이가 크지 않았습니다 어 생각보다 선방하는라는 생각이 들더라고요 그리고 3D 마크 테스트도 해봤습니다 저희가 와일드라이프 익스트림 스트레스 테스트를 해봤는데요 기본형과 플러스는 사실 막 큰 차이가 나진 않았습니다 베스 점수가 4,000 점대 나왔고요 최저 점수는 2,000 점대 거의 비슷하게 나왔는데 울트라에서 점수가 좀 더 높게 나오더라고요 최고 점수가 5,000점 대가 나왔고 최저 점수는 비슷하게 2,000 점 대가 나왔습니다 그리고 3D 마크 테스트 종료 직후 온도도 살펴봤는데요 울트라가 3도 정도 낮게 나오는 걸 확인할 수 있었어요 이번에 울트라에서 베이퍼 챔버가 전작 대비 두 배 가까이 커졌다고 하더라고요 그래서 확실히 방열에 좀 유리해진 구조를 가지고 있는게 아닐까 싶고요 또 저번에 개발자 분들한테 들어보니까 열을 방출하는 방향도 이전보다 더 다양해져서 좀 더 효과적으로 열 방출을 할 수 있게 됐다고 하더라고요 그러다 보니까 확실히 좀 고사양의 게임을 돌리고 싶어 하시는 분들 좀 더 장시간 사용을 하고 싶어 하시는 분들이라면 울트라를 선택하시면 좀 발열도 덜하고 더 높은 성능으로 사용할 수 있지 않을까 싶어요 스피커도 한번 들어 볼게요 갤럭시에는 돌비 에트모스 기능 있는 거 아시죠 돌비 에트모스 버튼 가져다가 켜서 들어보도록 할게요 근데 사실 사운드도 사운드인데 이게 최대 볼륨으로 듣고 있는데도 뒷면이 울림이 하나도 없는게 너무 좋다 이게 스피커가 빵빵 해도 막 진동이 생기면은이 게임할 때나 이럴 때 손에 잡고 하기 되게 불편하거든요 막  얘는이 정도로 베이스가 쾅쾅 울리는 노래인데도 전혀 떨림이 없어요 뒷면에 이게 되게 좋은데요 23이랑 비교도 한번 해볼게요 얘도 돌비 에트모스 켜놓은  상태 막 사운드 자체는 큰 차이 없는데 출력이 달라요 그래서 24 시리즈들이 스피커 출력이 더 좋다는 거 요런 차이도 있습니다 자 이렇게 해서 세 모델 모두 다 자세하게 살펴봤는데요 사실 구매 가이드를 하려고 시작을 했는데 어쩌다 보니까 막 종합 리뷰가 돼 버렸어요 쭉 얘기하면서 이미 말씀드렸지만 일반형 모델은 내가 진짜 가벼운 거 작은 거 쓰고 싶다 예산을 낮게 잡고 있다 하시는 분들이 선택할 만한 모델이라고 생각을 하고 좀 미리 치워 두르도록 하겠습니다 사실 저도 그렇고 가장 많은 분들이 고민하시는게 플러스 아니면 울트라 혹은 전작인 23 울트 아냐 24 울트 아냐 뭐 이런 정도의 고민을 하고 계실 텐데 사용을 해보고 제가 막 여러모로 살펴보고 나니까 사실 이거예요 제가 제일 중요하게 여기는 부분은 일단 손으로 들었을 때 무게에서 차이가 있거든요 거의 한 40g 정도 차이가 나는데 일단 저는 무거운 거 싫어해 가지고 확실히 가벼운 플러스가 좀 더 손이 많이 가기는 하더라고요 그런데 카 카메라를 써 보니까 울트라가 확실히 카메라가 너무 좋아 가지고 어디 여행 가할 때 쓰거나 아니면 영상 찍을 때 쓰거나 이런 거를 생각하면 진짜 울트라 사야 되나 이제 이런 생각도 들더라고요 그래서 여러분한테 좀 이거 결정할 때 따져 보실 만한 것들을 말씀을 드리자면 일단 가격 256gb 기준으로 전작과 동일합니다 그리고 512gb 기준으로 전작보다 22,000원 정도 올랐어요 자 그런데 중요한 거 일단 1테라 모델이 울트라에 man 있어요 나는 저작 공간을 많이 써야 된다 하시는 분이라면 울트라 선택하세요 그리고 가격이 플러스와 울트라는 512gb 기준으로 35만 원에서 40만 원 정도 차이가 나는데요 정도 가격 차이 나는 괜찮다 그리고 카메라 기능이 나는 진짜 중요하다 현답을 울트라로 가시면 되겠지만 반대로 어 나는 카메라 그렇게까지는 필요 없고 나는 게임을 그렇게 막 많이 할 것도 아니고 내가 AI 기능들을 쓸 수만 있으면 되고 그리고 좀 가벼운 폰을 쓰고 싶다 한다면 플러스요 정도의 조언을 드릴 수 있을 것 같고 저도 그래서 사실 처음에는 무조건 울트라 있는데 이게 보다 보니까 플러스가 가지고 있는 장점들도 있잖아 특히 AI 기능들도 다 동일하게 쓸 수 있고 또 성능면에서도 그렇게 뒤지지 않는 걸 확인을 하고 나니까 괜찮을 거 같더라고요 그래서 지금 저는 일단 플러스도 추가로 주문을 해 놓고 고민하는 중입니다 여러분 생각은 어떤가요 여러분 의견도 댓글로 남겨 주시면은 저도 실사용 메인폰으로 사용할 폰을 한번 잘 고민해서 골라보도록 할게요 저는 그러면 다음 영상에서 또 찾아뵙겠습니다 다음 는 실사용 장기사용 후기로 돌아오도록 할게요 안녕 빠이 여러분 지금이 배경 지금 보고 계신이 배경 이제는이 배경도 그렇게 길게 사용하진 않았어요 왜냐면 여기 이사온지도 얼마 안 됐기 때문에 근데 제가 이제 조소의 대표가 됩니다네 그래서 스튜디오를 계약을 하러 갈 거예요 좀 있다가 새로운 스튜디오에서 인사드릴 것 같은데 앞으로도 잘 부탁드립니다 주연 2.0이 시작됩니다 그리고 아까도 응급을 했지만 삼성전자 반도체 채널에서 또 열심히 진행하고 있는 유용한 콘텐츠가 있으니까 반도체 공부하고 싶으신 분들은 저랑 같이 그 영상 봐 주시면서 저랑 같이 반도체 공부 하셨으면 좋겠습니다 많이 시청해 주세요  안녕 우리는 다시 또  웃을테니까 \n",

호주 환경부 장관이 이렇게 얘기를 했습니다 야생 고양이가 매년 약 20억 마리의 동물을 죽이고 있다 게다가 호주는 고립되어 있는 대륙이기 때문에 호주만의 고유종이 진짜 많죠 근데 이 호주만의 고유종들이 야생 고양이 같은 침입종으로 그대로 절멸을 당하고 있기 때문에 호주의 생명 다양성 손실의 가장 큰 원인이다 그리고 고양이는 원래 호주에 없었던 겁니까? 침입종입니까? 침입종이요 외래종이요 그럼 호주가 바다인데 어떻게 들어왔냐 휴먼 휴먼들이 특히 유럽인들이 호주에 들어오면서 애완동물로 고양이를 데리고 왔는데 18세기 후반에 이 깃발 휘날리는 영국이 뭐 하면 다 영국인데 호주에 고양이를 데리고 옵니다 그리고 고양이를 처음 본 호주의 토착 생물들은 거의 속수무책 고양이가 귀여워 보이지만 생태계 거의 최종 포식자에 가깝죠 고양이를 잡아먹는 포식자들은 위에 물론 대형 포식 동물들이 있지만 대형 포식은 잘 없잖아요 거의 최종 포식자인데 호주의 소형 동물들은 완전 속수무책 34개의 토착종이 멸종을 했고요 200종 이상의 종이 멸종 위기에 몰려있죠 게다가 귀엽게 보이지만 고양이들의 살상 능력은 어마어마하다고 합니다 야생고양이 한 마리가 하루에 두 마리 꼴로 생물을 죽인다 1년에 한 마리가 700마리를 죽일 수 있다 호주에서만 하루에 야생고양이가 한 250만 마리 300만 마리  예상합니다 하루에 600만 마리의 생물이 고양이한테 죽는단 말이다 1년이면 20억 마리의 파충류 새, 작은 포유류, 유대류 이런 애들이 고양이에 죽고 있기 때문에 아까도 말씀드렸지만 호주가 희귀 동식물들의 낙원으로 불리죠 대단히 희귀한 호주에만 있는 이런 조그만 소형 유대류들 우리는 잘 모르는 빌비, 코알라, 캥거루 이렇게 큰 애들만 아는데 작은 애들도 많이 있어요 빌비, 베통, 넘밧 뭐 이렇게 얘기하는데 다 멸종위기 중입니다 극심한 개체수 감소 고양이의 상대가 안 되죠 피해 도망도 못 가고 상대가 안 되기 때문에 걸리면 죽는 그런 입장이라고 할 수 있고 18세기 후반에 유럽인들이 데려온 고양이가 지금 야생고양이가 호주 전역에 얼마나 퍼져 있냐 사실상 99.9 % 고양이가 없는 지역이 없다 고양이는 생존 능력도 대단합니다 더워도 심지어 사막에서도 버틸 수 있기 때문에 280만 마리 정도가 넓게 퍼져있구요 물론 많이 모여 사는 데는 있죠 호주 정부가 고양이 개체수를 그럼 좀 조절해 보자 멸종할 수는 없으니까 토착 생물들이 호주가 그동안 많은 야생동물과의 싸움에서 대부분 대패를 했던 이유는 하.. 이게.. 만만해 77배야 이게 뭐 사막이고 뭐.. 이걸 어떻게 잡을 거냐 아까 전에 낙타 같은 애들이야 헬기 타면서 잡았는데 이거는 불가능한 애들이죠 게다가 최상위 포식자 숲, 산림지대, 초원, 늪지, 건조지대 심지어 도심에서도 삽니다 옛날에는 그나마 호주 원주민들이 많았을 때는 원주민들이 얘네를 식용으로도 잡아먹었대 1890년대 아주 옛날에 왜냐하면 토착종이 줄어드니까 원래 걔들을 잡아먹고 살다가 야생 고양이들이라도 잡아먹었는데 휴먼이라도 어떻게 해봤는데 지금은 그런 소리 하면은 몰매 맞죠 그런 소리 하면은 한국인들 개고기 먹냐 라는 소리하고 똑같기 때문에 원주민이 옛날에 고양이를 포식했다는 전설 같은 얘기가 있는 거지 요즘 원주민들한테 이런 소리 하면은 돌맞을 일이지 무슨 말도 안 되는 1800년대 조선시대 얘기하고 있는 거라고 생각을 하죠 그거랑 똑같이 고양이 잡아먹는 뭐 이런 건 다 없어졌고요 그러다 보니까 호주 야생 고양이를 잡을 수 있는 천적도 없고 그래서 호주가 야생 고양이를 국가적 외래종으로 선포합니다 호주 역사상 가장 파괴적인 침입 외래종이다 이거는 뭐 어떻게 할 수가 없다 그래서 호주 환경부 장관이 이렇게 표현을 했습니다 야생 들고양이는 몰래 따라와 습격하는 무자비한 살인자들에 가깝다 우리가 지금 행동하지 않으면 토착 동물들은 살아남을 기회가 없다고 선언을 한 거죠 그래서 2015년에 200만 마리의 야생 고양이들을 줄여야 된다 야생고양이 숫자를 280만, 300만 정도 보니까 3분의 2 정도의 고양이 숫자를 줄여야 된다 어떻게든 사살을 하건 약을 통하건 어떻게든 줄여야 된다 그리고 환경보호론자들도 이때 일부이긴 하지만 호주 생태계를 과거로 되돌릴 수 있다는 거니까 나름 지지를 했습니다 다만 어떻게가 문제죠 어떻게 형을 어떻게 잡냐 이 헬기를 타고 낙타 숫자를 조절했잖아요 기관총을 쏴가면서 낙타 숫자를 조절했는데 낙타 전쟁에서 승리한 것처럼 헬기를 타면서 이 고양이를 잡을 수 있냐 자동차로는 불가능하고 남한의 70배라는데 불가능하고 될 리가 없죠 낙타들이야 무리생활을 하고 저렇게 멍청하게 큰 놈들이 몰려다니니까 그렇지만 고양이는 야행성이야 어디에 숨어있어 야 헬기 타고 다니면서 그거 언제 잡어 200만 마리, 200만 마리 게다가 굴을 파고 굴 안에 있어요 이게 될 리가 없고 그럼 한 마리씩 차를 타고 다니면서 총으로 물론 잡을 수 있죠 아까도 얘기 드렸듯이 목표가 200만 마리입니다 고양이는 생후 5개월부터 새끼를 낳는데 여러 마리 낳죠 그러면 잡는 게 빠르냐 태어나는 게 빠르냐 그리고 이거 호주 전역 대륙에 99% 퍼져 있다는데 이거 언제 답이 없죠 그래서 호주 정부도 휴먼도 아이디어를 냅니다 독극물이 담긴 소세지를 무한 투하하겠다 하하하 어.. 근데 이것도 쉽지 않아요 왜냐하면 첫 번째 이건 고양이만 죽는 게 아니죠 다른 생물들도 죽을 수 있어요 두 번째, 고양이가 너무 넓게 퍼져 있어요 호주 대륙의 99%입니다 타겟팅하기도 어렵고 너무 넓게 퍼져 있고 이거를 너무 많이 뿌리면 환경단체들이 다른 생물 죽는다고 난리를 치니까 이게 어려워요 잘못하면 인간들 피해를 볼 수 있죠 그러다 보니까 고양이만 타겟팅할 수 있는 아이디어가 없냐? 있었습니다 그건 뭐냐? 이런 별소리 다 하네  진짜 별 아이디어가 다 나오는데 고양이가 털을 핥으라 그래 고양이 털을 핥으니까 털에다가 독극물을 묻히면 이렇게 털을 핥다가 털에다가 독극물을 묻히면 하다가 갈 수 있다 그래서 실제로 이 아이디어로 털 독극물 분사를 시도합니다 200대 생각해보면 도심이나 고양이가 많이 밀집되어 있는 효과가 있는데 99%의 호주 대륙에 이거 투입하기 힘들죠 이 기계는 특수 카메라 아마 AI 같은 게 달려있겠죠 특수 카메라를 봐서 지나가면 삐삑 캥거루 안 쏴 삐삑 코알라 안 쏴 삐삑 킹냥이네 이러면 뿅 쏜다는 거죠 이런 특수한 능력까지 가진 놀라운 AI 카메라가 있었는데 문제는 자꾸 얘기하지만 나만의 70배 뭐 이렇게 얘기하니까 호주 전역에다가 이거 배치하기도 힘들고 200대 택도 없는 거죠 그래서 결국에는 2015년에 그런 목표를 세웠지만 패배했죠 될 리가 없었고요 패배했고 2023년에 호주 환경부 장관이 다시 한 번 얘기한 겁니다 우리는 그동안 이 전쟁을 수행했지만 결국 졌다 하지만 멈출 수 없죠 다시 한 번 야생 고양이와의 전쟁을 선포한다 Declaring war 실제 이런 표현을 썼습니다 선전포고하는 거죠 다시 한 번 간다 8년간의 전투 끝에 우리가 패배했지만 새로운 전투 계획을 수립 중이다 새로운 전투 계획이 뭐였을까요? 기존의 야생 고양이와의 전쟁에 성과를 거두지 못한 이유는? 열 번쯤 얘기 드렸지만 77배 이게 어려웠고 그 다음에 두 번째 아무리 많이 잡아도 유입을 막지 못했다 무슨 소리입니까? 많이 잡긴 많이 잡았는데 도시 고양이들이 야생에 유입되는 걸 유입을 막지 못하면 아무리 죽여야 소용이 없더라 그럼 유입을 막아야 된다 근데 유입이 어디서 되냐 보니까 도시 고양이들이 유입이 된다 그럼 도시 고양이는 뭐예요? 결국 집에서 기르던 고양이가 유기되거나 길거리를 내쫓기면 이들이 도시에 있다가 야생으로 끊임없이 유입이 되더라 이거를 막지 않는 한 유입된 거 잡아봐야 지금까지 아무 소용이 없었다 그럼 이 유입되는 거를 막아야 되는데 어떻게 막아야 되냐? 한마디로 호주가 얘기하는 거는 무한 공급이 되는 애완 고양이 집고양이의 야생 진입을 막아야 된다 애완 고양이는 길고양이가 될 수 있고 길고양이는 야생동물이 되는데 지금까지 우리는 야생 고양이와만 싸워왔는데 이제는 애완 고양이에 대한 대화를 시작할 때가 되었다 애완 고양이가 야생화 되는 걸 어떻게 막을 건지에 대한 대화를 해야 된다 문제는 고양이는 귀엽습니다 아 어려워요 고양이는 귀여워 너무나 너무나 큰 쉴드야 버프그 자체예요 푸바오 봐봐 귀여우면 다냐? 다야 팬더 봐봐 미쳤어? 팬더는 곰이 아니냐 곰 옆에 불곰도 있고, 반달가슴곰도 있고 우리나라 곰은 반달가슴곰은 지리산을 헤매다가 엑 죽어도 뉴스도 안되는데 푸바오는 길가다가 넘어지면 아아 야 우리 푸바오 넘어졌어요 야 푸바오 두들기면 야 우리 푸바오 두 대나 두들겼어요 이게 뉴스가 되는데 반달가슴곰은 배고파서 굶어죽어도 뭐 두 마리 죽었나벼? 뭐 이러고 넘어간단 말이에요 쇼이면 다인데 고양이는 너무나 친숙하고 너무나 인기가 있고 인간 최대의 반려동물이에요 게다가 개보다 어렵습니다 개보다 왜냐 현대사회는 개보다 고양이를 더 선호해요 옛날엔 그렇지 않았어요 옛날에는 우리가 개는 키워놓고 키우면 되니까 인류는 옛날이라고 아주 옛날 개를 당연히 선호했는데 요즘은 안 그래요 왜냐? 개보다 고양이가 키우기가 훨씬 쉽습니다 강형욱 아저씨 봐봐요 개 키우기 어렵다는 말 요즘엔 맨날 나와요 이 개는 점수가 10점짜리예요 절대 키우면 안 돼요 3년은 보셔야 됩니다 심지어 20년을 보셔야 되고 이런 이 개는 하루에 산책을 3시간 해야 돼요 미친 거 아닙니까? 어휴 3시간 어떻게 해요 그걸 두 번 해야 됩니다 뭐 이런 얘기 하잖아 3시간 산책을 2번 하래 야 씨 이거 개가 날 키우지 내가 개를 키우는겨? 게다가 3시간 산책뿐만 아니라 요즘에 뭐라더라? 개가 무슨 운동해야 된다고 뒤에다 타이어 끌고 그걸 개를 시키래 야 그건 럭비 선수가 하는 운동이잖아 나도 그 운동을 하는데 개에다가 타이어를 끌고 개가 으긋으긋 하면서 끄는걸 그걸 시켜야 된다고 이런 얘기를 하니까 개가 날 키우는지 모르니까 개 키우기 힘들어요 조그만 개 강아지들 아니면 힘들고 근데 고양이는 산책 시키라고 그러면 싫어하죠 고양이는 뭔 소리 닝겐 저리 가라, 집사 저리 가라 이런 소리 하고 있으니까 개는 산책 안 시켜주면 으르릉 난리 치는데 고양이는 그런 것도 없어요 고양이는 또 휴머니 나갔다가 들어와도 갔다 왔냐?! 시크하단 말이야 근데 개는 인간이 나가려고 그러면 막 가지 말라고 난리 치고 돌아오면 오빠, 아이고 오빠래 아빠 지금 돌아왔군요 뭐 이러니까 젊은 세대는 게다가 공간도 훨씬 덜 찾아요 고양이를 선호할 수밖에 없습니다 도시에서는 고양이를 키우는 게 훨씬 쉬워요 저희 지금 옛날에 어렸을 때 개 7마리 키웠습니다 7마리 개판이었어요 개판 물론 그때 마당이 넓은 집이었어 마당이 넓고 당시에는 또 개 많이 키웠어요 또 정말 개처럼 키웠죠 이게 무슨 소리냐 문 열어놓고 개들이 동네를 휩쓸고 다녀 개 무리가 있어요 조그만 요만한 개들 무리들이 동네 휩쓸고 다니면 지나가다 차이는 게 개였고 뭐 산책은 무슨 산책이야 문 열고 알아서 놀고 알아서 들어오는 거지 게다가 밥도 무슨 대충 사료에다가 사람이 먹던 거 섞어주면 그게 밥이죠 말 그대로 개밥이었는데 요즘엔 그렇게 안 키우잖아 개는 옛날에는 샤워는 비 오는 날에 하는 겁니다 못 놀면 샤워야 밖에 돌아다니면 뭐 그런 게 개똥도 찾으면 없다 이런 소리를 했던 때니까 요즘에는 산책도 시켜야 되고 심지어 놀이도 해야 돼 옛날에는 인간이 혼자 놀기 심심하니까 개를 키웠는데 요즘엔 반대로 개님이 놀아주셔야 되는데 인간이 참여해야 되는 이게 바뀌었고 근데 고양이는 그냥 집에서 타워 적당히 만들어주면 집사가 오든 말든 쿨하죠 시크하고 집사가 한 10시간쯤 일하다 들어와도 쿨하게 받아주고 개를 키우려면 1년에 2,500달러 들어가는데 고양이는 가격도 싸다 먹는 것도 적게 먹어요 개는 얼마나 7마리 키울 때 얼마나 처먹는지 하 참 우와, 넷이 고기 한번 먹으러 가면 고기 뼈 챙겨오는 게 제 일이었습니다 고깃집 가서 갈비 같은 거 먹으면 죄송한데 사장님 뼈 좀 주시면 안 될까요? 뼈 좀 붙여 있는 거 개 주면 그 뼈를 하루 종일 씹어 먹어요 개들이 소뼈를 부셔먹습니다 부셔먹기 때문에 그걸 또 땅을 파갖고 어디다가 자꾸 묻어 파리 날려 이것들이 먹고 두면 되는데 그걸 자꾸 숨겨 뭐 그런 게 있었는데 고양이는 깔끔하죠 으으으 이런 거 하고 깔끔하고 돈도 훨씬 적게 되기 때문에 훨씬 키우기도 쉽고 그래서 도시에서는 최근에는 고양이가 훨씬 더 인기가 많죠 중국 같은 데는 애완용 개가 1,805만 마리야 씨 장난 아니구나 고양이가 6,980만 마리 한국인들 머리 숫자보다 많습니다 한국인들 머리 숫자보다 많기 때문에 애완용 고양이가 잘하면 1억 가겄다 1억 가겄어 압도적으로 인기고요 뉴욕 같은 대도시에서도 마찬가지라 그럽니다 현대에는 개보다 고양이가 인기가 더 좋아요 사진으로 판별을 해보면 애완동물 사진 중에 뉴욕에서 60%가 고양이 같다 고양이 인기가 좋다는 거죠 호주에서도 당연하게 고양이 인기가 좋습니다 물론 호주는 땅이 넓기 때문에 개는 인기가 좋은데 호주 가구 중 고양이를 키우는 비율이 2002년 기준 33% 와 미쳤다 우리나라에서 키우기 좀 좋긴 하죠 애완용 고양이 숫자가 530만 마리? 뭐 엄청나다고 할 수 있습니다 특히 팬데믹 기간, 코로나 기간 중에 애완동물 키우는 비율이 급격히 늘어났죠 우리나라도 마찬가지인데 집에 다 있으니까 고양이 한번 키워볼까? 개는 키우기 너무 힘들단 말이야 산책 강형욱 아저씨가 3시간 하라고 그랬는데 좀 쉬운 놈 없나? 얘는 2시간만 하면 돼요 산책 안 하는 강아지 없습니까? 그런 건 없어요 이렇게 된단 말이에요 게다가 자꾸 짖어 아랫집에서 올라와 이 집 설마 개 키우는 건 아니죠? 그럼 아유 우리 집 개는 안 물어요 우리 집 개는 조용해요 뭐 이런 얘기를 해야 되니까 근데 우리 집 고양이는 조용해요 이런 얘기는 없잖아 고양이는 사실 그거 떼주면 잘 울지도 않습니다 물론 그걸 죄송한 표현이지만 그걸 좀 떼야 된다는 단점이 있지만 땅콩 하나 떼주면 애가 조용해 땅콩 안 떼주면 조금 밤새 이걸 많이 하는데 그것만 떼면 미안해 그것만 떼면 조용하기 때문에 아랫집에 그래도 살포시 다닌단 말이야 애들 살포시 살포시 걔는 쿵쾅쿵쾅 다니는데 그것도 없기 때문에 팬데믹 기간 중에 애완동물을 더 많이 키우셨겠고 호주의 애완동물 비율이 사상 최고치를 기록했죠 애완동물 비율이 갑자기 올라간다는 말은 다른 말로 하면은 유기되는 고양이가 갑자기 늘어난다는 말과 똑같습니다 새로운 집냥이가 새로운 애완동물이 갑자기 늘면 유기 고양이도 갑자기 늘어나요 호주에서 공식적으로 확인된 유기 고양이의 수가 전년 대비 40%가 증가하게 됩니다 코로나가 끝나고 나니까 코로나 때는 집에서 오래 있기 때문에 키웠지만 이제 자기들 나가게 되니까 고양이들을 집에서 못 키우겠다 고양이뿐만 아니라 모든 유기 동물이 마찬가지인데 돈이 없거나 시간이 없어서 길거리에 고양이나 개나 수많은 애완동물 심지어 요즘에는 열대어도 버리더라고요 열대어를 열대어를 우리나라 하천에 버리는 사람들은 무슨 생각을 하는지 잘 모르겠어요 잠깐 살라는 거죠 잠깐 살고 겨울엔 죽을 것 같냐 아무 죄책감 없이 버리는데 그러다가 우리나라 하천에서 요즘에 열대어 발견이 돼서 유튜버들이 신나서 열대어 찍으러 다니죠 아 그런 거 버리면 안 됩니다 별걸 다 버리는데 고양이도 그럴 수밖에 없었죠 저소득 가구 중 14%가 자신들의 동물을 포기하는 비극적인 결정을 내려야 됐다 동물 보호소들은 너무 고양이가 많이 들어오니까 그 수치를 따라잡고자 노력을 하지만 커버가 안 되는 거죠 수십만 마리가 되니까 그러면 근본적으로 유기 고양이의 야생 유입을 막아야 되는데 이걸 어떻게 할 거냐가 호주의 고민이라고 할 수 있습니다 한마디로 도시 고양이 관리 우리가 키우는 고양이의 관리 고양이를 분양 받거나 고양이를 유기하지 못하도록 분양도 조금 어렵게 만들고 유기도 조금 어렵게 만들고 이런 게 필요하다는 거죠 그리고 유기 고양이는 사살 같은 걸 못하죠 아무리 호주어도 야생 고양이는 야생에 있는 여우나 야생에 있는 낙타나 야생에 있는 뭐는 이렇게 쏴서 잡지만 개체수를 조절하기 위해서 야생 고양이는 호주도 사살을 합니다 근데 도시 있는 유기 고양이는 사살을 못하죠 그 장면 하나하나가 동물 애호가들한테는 너무나 큰 충격이기 때문에 야생과 또 유기는 또 다릅니다 심지어 야생 고양이를 죽이는 것도 호주에서 고양이를 사랑하는 분들은 이거 엄청나게 반대하기 때문에 물론 호주에서는 그래도 호주 고유종을 지키는 게 너무 크기 때문에 어느 정도는 하지만 동물 권리 단체들이 사살 정책에 대해서 굉장히 반대를 합니다 그런데 유기 고양이는 더구나 힘들고 그래서 이건 법으로 뭔가를 해야 된다 애완용 고양이를 대상으로 하는 법령 제도가 필요하다 예를 들면 일부인데 아직 통과가 다 된 건 아니고 모든 애완 고양이를 항상 실내에 가둬둘 것 나가서 절대 유기하지 못할 것 이런 법률을 만들든지 고양이를 입양할 때 어떤 법적인 뭐를 요구한다든지 아니면 애완용 고양이를 키운 사람들이 모두 고양이를 등록하고 의무적으로 중성화 애완 고양이끼리 이거를 못하고 고양이를 분양하는 데서만 분양을 하고 거기에서만 생식을 하고 거길 나가는 데는 전부 다 떼라는 거죠 땅콩 전부 다 중성화시켜서 애완용으로 키우게 한다든지 하는 강력한 법률 정말 강력한 거죠 모든 애완용 고양이를 지금부터라도 아니면 분양할 때 전부 다 중성화시켜서 내보내야 된다 항상 실내에 가두고 바깥에 못 데리고 나온다 이런 법령들은 정말 센 법령들인데 통과될지 모르겠지만 이런 거를 추진한다는 거죠 물론 고양이 보호협회는 다른 방법도 얘기를 합니다 그건 뭐냐? 고양이를 호주의 일부로 받아들이면 되지 않냐? 호주 토착종만 생물이냐? 고양이를 굳이 그렇게 박멸하려고 노력할 거 있냐? 고양이도 호주 자연의 일부야 이제 우리가 됐어 들어온 지 오래됐잖아 19세기에 들어왔다며 19세기 1800년도 후반에 그럼 이미 100년 이상이면 우리야 호주 일부로 받아들이고 토착종만 생물이냐? 토착종을 보호하는 거는 다른 방법 걔들만 이렇게 따로 보호구역을 만들어 준다든지 걔네들만 이렇게 하는 걸 또 다른 방법을 생각해야지 고양이를 그렇게 박멸하면 되겠냐? 라고 이제 주장을 하죠 한마디로 선택의 문제이긴 한데 고유의 생물의 다양성을 관리하고 유지를 하는 쪽으로 갈 거냐? 이러면 결국에 아까 말했듯이 강력한 법안 집고양이를 포함해서 고양이 개체수량 강력한 법안일 거고 아니면 고양이도 그냥 받아들이면 자연으로 인정을 하면 결국 고양이냐 생물다양성이냐 이걸 호주에서는 지금 선택을 해야 되는 그런 문제가 있죠 물론 당연하겠지만 고양이는 별 잘못이 없습니다 고양이는 잘못이 없는데 고양이는 사실은 문제가 아니죠 잘 관리만 된다면 진짜 문제는 키우다가 길거리로 고양이를 버리는 사람들이기 때문에 집에서만 잘 관리가 되고 잘 중성화만 돼서 집에서만 키우고 바깥으로 외부로 자연으로 나가지 않으면 사실 상관이 없는데 자꾸 고양이를 들여온다면 다음에 키우기 힘들다고 유기하고 그러면 자연으로 자꾸 가는 그 루트를 어떻게 하면 막냐가 호주에서 굉장히 이슈가 되고 있죠 길거리에 고양이를 버리는 사람들이 문제라는 거죠 근데 귀엽다고 데려와서 상황이 바뀌어서 못 키울 것 같으니까 어떻게 하냐 그러니까 어쩔 수 없이 버린다 그럼 자연으로 가고 이들이 수많은 생물을 잡고 또 우리는 이 고양이들을 또 잡아야 되는 그런 상황에 처하기 때문에 이 고리를 끊는 게 호주에서 굉장히 이슈가 되고 있죠 사실 이건 뭐 호주만의 문제는 아닙니다 하와이 같은 경우에서도 최근에 고양이 문제 때문에 집고양이들을 어떻게 잘 관리할 수 있는가가 우리의 과제로 떠오르고 있습니다 아마 현명한 방법으로 고양이와 인간이 잘 어울려 살 수 있는 그런 대책과 이런 지혜가 나오지 않을까 생각을 합니다 \n",

      " 오오오  이번달 일본에서 발매된 주술에 전 20권 에는 후식으로 토지의 일상이 실려 있습니다 짧은 부록 이지만 이번에 공개된 내용을 통해 몇 가지 의문점이 해소된 부분이 있어서 영상으로 만들어 보았습니다 주술에 전편 북에는 주요 캐릭터의 나이가 기재되어 있고 이것은 2018 년 10월 31일 시부야 사가 시점에 나이입니다 먼저 시부야 사변 당시 고조에 나이는 28살 메구미는 15살 일본은 만나 이를 사용하기 때문에 12월생 인 두 사람은 생일이 지나지 않아서 아직 한 살을 먹지 않았지만 2018년 은 각각 29 16이 되는 해입니다 그리고 2018년 으로부터 12년전 성장 체 아마 나의 리코의 사례 사건이 일어났습니다 시부야 사변이 끝난 후 2 쿠모 육지와 함께 텡게 늘 만나러 갔을 때 즉 금오도 탱 겐도 성장 체사레 사건을 11년전 이라고 말해 팬들을 어리둥절하게 만들었는데 이것은 후에 단행 분이 나오며 12년 전으로 수정이 되었으므로 이 사건은 2006년에 일입니다 장식 오존은 주수 고전 2학년 나이는 16살 때 고민은 세 살입니다 1녀 도 2007년 08월 4 토르는 최강희 되었다 개 토스 그루가 주저 설 없어 처형 대상이 된 2007년 고조에 나이는 17살 메구미는 네 살입니다 초등학교 1학년 때 내 부친과 춤이 키에 모친 각자 한쪽 부모가 눈이 맞아 증 발했다 외국 이가 초등학교에 입학한 것은 2009년 4월 이때 고조는 19살 메구미는 여섯 살입니다 주술에 전 7권 에서 매 구미에 회상이 나왔을 당시에는 과거 편의 시작하기 전 이었기 때문에 아무런 위화감이 없었지만 바로 이어서 시작된 과거 편에서 토지가 사망했습니다 그리고 사망한 지 3년이 되었는데 외 구미는 마치 얼마 전 두 사람이 증발한 것처럼 얘기 했기 때문에 이 부분이 다시 그 화제가 되며 그가 아빠 라고 생각하는 인물이 토지가 아닌 다른 사람일 가능성 과 사실은 고조 와의 전투에서 토지가 죽지 않았다는 추측이 나오기 시작했습니다 그리고 개개 선생은 이 것을 의식한 듯 9건 에서는 몇 년이나 만나지 않아서 얼굴이 기억나지 않는다 는 대사를 넣어 토지가 죽었다 는 점을 명확히 있습니다 즉 몇 년동안 만나지 않은 토지 며칠 전부터 사라진 츠미키 에 엄마 이젠 인가와 의 거래로 큰 돈을 받았을 거라는 추추 이것들이 합쳐져 토지와 주 미키 엄마가 함께 증발해 어딘가에서 잘 살고 있을 거라는 결론에 이른 것입니다 한편 0 시우가 토지 에게 외국 위해 안부를 묻자 토지는 매 구미 라는 사람 자체를 기억하지 못했습니다 나중에 자기 아들이 매 구미 라는 것을 깨달았고 사실은 아들에게 애정이 있었다는 것과 내심 젠 인가에 보내고 싶지 않았다는 것이 밝혀졌지만 아들의 존재 자체를 잊은 부분이 너무 커서 쓰레기 아빠 라는 오명을 완전히 벗을 수는 없었습니다 그래서 아들의 이름을 잊을 정도면 대체 얼마 통한 만나지 않았던 것인지 한 집에 살았던 시기 가 있긴 있는 것인지 이런 의문이 남았는데요 이번 주술에 전 20권 에 실린 부록으로 여기에 대한 궁금증이 해소 되었습니다 밖에서 싸우고 돌아온 매 구미를 스 미끼가 혼내는 장면인데 그녀는 싸움은 하는게 아니라 말리는 것이 라는 특이한 말을 합니다 알고보니 이것은 과거의 토지가 한 말로 집에서 tv 를 보고 있는 토지가 등장 누군가와 싸워서 쓰러뜨려 맞자 나중에 교사나 경찰이 시끄럽지 않아 하지만 누군가의 싸움을 말리면 칭찬 받을 수 있고 덤으로 최소한 두 명 때릴 수 있어 다시 말에 말리는 척하면서 2명을 때려 높이면 스트레스 해소와 칭찬 두 마리 토끼를 잡을 수 있다는 토지 다운 명언 인데요 어떤 이치인 지지 미키는 이해할 수 없었지만 어쨌든 이것을 제대로 기억하고 내 구미에 게도 가르치고 있었습니다 gpt 는 매 구미 보다 1살 많기 때문에 토지 사망 당시 네 살에서 5살 정신 연구결과에 따르면 인간은 세 살까지 의 기억은 되게 없는 것으로 알려져 있으며 이것을 유아 기억상실증 이라고 합니다 그리고 내 5사 사이에 기억 횟수가 급격히 증가 에 정차 선명한 기억을 갖게 된다고 하는데요 물론 모든 사람에게 적용되는 것은 아니지만 작중 그녀가 특별히 머리가 좋다거나 하는 묘사는 없으므로 평범했다 는 전제하에 토지의 얼굴 말과 행동을 제대로 기억하고 있는 것을 보면 회상 장면은 4g 가 사망한 2006년 쯤 일어난 일이 아닐까 생각합니다 결론적으로 토지가 한 집에 살았던 시기는 분명히 있고 의외로 메구미와 도 최근까지 만났을 가능성이 높은데 이름을 기억하지 못한 것은 쓰레기 물 강조해서 나중에 반전 효과를 출연한 작가의 계획이었다 는 것이겠죠 또한 자신은 남자 이름을 기억하지 못한다는 말도 하는데 자기 아들을 남자 카테고리에 넣어야 하는 건지는 잘 모르겠습니다 아직 풀리지 않은 수수께끼는 주 미키 모친 인데요 단순히 아이를 버리고 가출한 것인지 뭔가 사고가 있었는지는 밝혀지지 않았고 캔 적극 계획 설이 있긴 하지만 짐이 키가 마킹 되었다는 건 왜 근거는 없습니다 메구미는 아직 아빠가 살아 있는 줄 아는데 대개 선생은 토지에 대한 것은 고조 사토루 의 입으로 매 구미 에게 전해야 한다고 생각하고 있다고 했으므로 옥문 강에서 나온 후 어쨌든 한 번은 고조와 매 구미가 만날 것으로 보입니다 그럼 저는 다음 영상으로 돌아오겠습니다 구독과 알림 설정을 하시면 가장 빠르게 영상을 보실 수 있습니다 시청해주셔서 감사합니다  \n",

      "생명의 위협을 무릅쓰고 남한에 넘어온 탈북민들은 이 땅에서 '생업'을 해결해야 하는 현실에 놓이게 됩니다. 낯선 장소, 낯선 사람들 사이에서 홀로서기를 시작하는 탈북민에게 '취업'은 가장 큰 '정착' 과정이 될 텐데요. 하지만 정보 부족과 편견이란 벽에 가로막혀 탈북민 스스로가 취업을 하는 건 쉽지 않다고 하죠. 이런 탈북민들의 고용을 지원하고, 취업 기회를 제공하기 위한 캠페인이 있는데요. 이 캠페인을 통해 탈북민들이 취업에 성공한 현장에 김옥영 리포터가 다녀왔습니다. 함께 보시죠. 한국에 정착한 지 7년째, 탈북민 정희 씨가 길을 나섭니다. 오늘 어디 가시는 길인가요? 출근하는 길이에요. (출근요? 어디로 출근하시나요?) 농어민문화체육센터요. 활기차게 나선 출근길. 힘찬 시동 소리와 함께 일터로 출발합니다. 회사로 가는 길에는 늘 경쾌한 음악이 함께한다고 하는데요. 어떤 기분으로 출근하시나요? 출근을 하게 되면 나도 이런 직업이 있고 직장인이라는 것만으로도 출근하는 자체가 좋아요. 차로 20여 분 거리의 직장에 도착했습니다. (도착했네요.) 네, 여기입니다. 이제 가장 중요한 순서가 남았는데요. (이건 뭐 하는 거예요?) 출근 도장 찍는 거예요. (출근 도장, 제일 중요한 거네요.) 지난 4월 이곳에 채용된 정희 씨는 시설 관리와 대관업무를 주로 맡고 있습니다. 탈북민이 남녘에서 성공적으로 정착하는데 직업을 구하는 건 대단히 중요한 요소인데요. 남북하나재단의 1사 1인 캠페인으로 취업에 성공한 정희 씨는 이 직장에서 어떤 꿈을 키워가고 있을까요. 본격적인 업무 개시와 함께, 시설 점검에 나섭니다. 안전과 위생을 중심으로, 곳곳을 꼼꼼하게 살펴봅니다. 창문이 열려있는지 수돗물이 물 흐르게 떨어지고 있는지 수전(수도꼭지)들 체크하고 바닥이랑 아무 이상 없는지 확인하는 겁니다. 사무실로 돌아와서는 대관 일정을 정리하고, 운영 자료를 능숙하게 챙기는데요. 2018년 한국에 도착한 정희 씨는 취업을 위해 만반의 준비를 해 왔다고 합니다. 자격증은 세무회계 2급이랑 FAT(회계정보 활용능력) 1급이랑, ERP(전사적 자원정보 관리사) 1급, ITQ(정보기술자격) 다 있습니다. 덕분에 업무에도 빠르게 적응할 수 있었다고 하는데요. 취업에 대해서 교육도 받고 다 했기 때문에 크게 우려되는 건 없어요. 지금은 직원들하고 잘 어울리고 열심히 하는 모습도 좋고 아주 만족하고 있습니다. 여러 자격증과 빼곡히 필기한 노트에서 그동안의 노력을 짐작해 볼 수 있습니다. 엑셀에는 영어들이 많이 나오더라고요. 제가 영어가 약해서 못 알아듣는 부분이 너무 많았고 처음에는 이렇게 여기 위탁 관리랑 위탁 관리 도구 (용어를) 이해 못했어요. 과거 정희 씨는 생계를 위해 취업 전선에 여러 번 도전했지만 결과는 쓰디쓰기만 했습니다. 면접까지 잘 봤는데 마지막에 가서 고향이 어디냐는 (질문에) 이북이라고 이야기하면 연락도 없고 그렇더라고요. 이제는 안정된 직장에서 조금씩 평범한 꿈을 키워가고 있는데요. 가족들이 건강하고 행복하게 사는 게 바라는 거고요. 지금 회사에 채용되기까지는 조력자의 도움이 컸다고 합니다. 남북하나재단 상담사 선생님입니다. 제 취업에 많은 도움을 주신 분이에요. 오늘 방문은 정희 씨의 회사 생활을 알아보고, 응원과 격려를 전하기 위해서라는데요. 남북하나재단에서 지난해부터 진행 중인 '1사 1인' 캠페인의 하나입니다. 어때요. 업무는 적응 잘하신 거예요? (아직 적응 중이에요.) 상대적으로 낮은 고용률, 높은 실업률을 보이는 탈북민들이 취업을 통해 자립할 수 있도록 돕고 있는 건데요. 남북하나재단에선 취업관리시스템을 구축해 공공기관 등 정규직 일자리를 대상으로 직업 훈련을 마친 탈북민을 연결해 주고 있습니다. (1사 1인 캠페인은) 한 업체에서 북한이탈주민을 한 명씩 채용하자 이런 사회적 분위기를 만들고자 남북하나재단에서 진행하고 있는 캠페인입니다. 오늘도 많은 탈북민들이 구직의 문을 두드리고 있는데요. 무엇보다 1사 1인 캠페인이 확대되기 위해서는 편견과 차별을 지우는 기업과 사회의 노력이 필요한 상황입니다. 서울 서초구의 한 병원. 2019년 한국에 온 영옥 씨가 간호조무사로 근무 중입니다. 안녕하세요. (안녕하세요. 반갑습니다.) 영옥 씨는 5개월 전 1사 1인 캠페인을 통해 이 병원에 취업했는데요. 자신만의 방법으로 주어진 업무를 야무지게 처리해 나가고 있습니다. 검사를 할 때 검사 순서 이렇게 적어 놓은 거 혼자 보고 있는 거예요. (정리해 놓으신 거구나.) 네. 출퇴근길 틈틈이 외운 전문 용어도 이제 제법 익숙해졌다고 하는데요. 낯선 단어를 외울 땐 재치를 발휘하기도 했습니다. (이거는 뭐예요?) 토니캣(채혈 고무줄)이요. 가수 토니 그분 이름이 토니잖아요. (H.O.T. 토니요?) 네, 그런 식으로 외우고 그랬거든요. 북한에서 군인이었던 영옥 씨는 탈북해 중국을 거쳐 한국에 오게 되었는데요. 우리 혈압 한번 재볼게요. 종종 자신의 말투와 억양에 낯설어하는 환자들을 만날 때면 주눅이 들었다고 합니다. (환자가) '말투가 어디 사람이에요' 하고 여쭤볼 때 그때 당황스럽죠. 그런 영옥 씨에게 동료들은 가장 큰 힘이 되는 존재인데요. (환자가) '어디서 왔어요.' 그렇게 여쭤보시거든요. 그러면 '저 강원도인데요.' 그렇게 대답하거든요. 다른 선생님들이 웃으시거나 그런 게 아니고 괜찮다고 괜찮다고 당당하게 얘기하라고 그렇게 말씀해주셔서 그건 진짜 좋은 것 같아요. 틈틈이 소통하며, 남과 북의 경계를 허물어 나가는 일터. 아까 환자 바이탈(건강 상태) 괜찮았어요? (네, 다 좋았습니다.) 직원들이 가졌던 약간의 편견은 함께 일하며 지워 나갔다고 합니다. 탈북민이라는 사실을 아시는 분들도 꽤 많아요. 개인적인 질문도 많을 거고 곤란한 상황도 많을 텐데 잘 이겨내시고 유연하게 대답도 잘 해주시고 오히려 재치 있게 풀어나가시는 편도 있으시고 그러시더라고요. 영옥 씨의 채용 사례가 좋은 선례를 남기며 또 다른 탈북민 채용의 문을 열어가고 있습니다. 직원들이 함께 근무하면서 만족도가 높아지고 이런 분이 계시면 또 채용할 수 있는 의향도 있고 직원들 만족도도 높고 열심히 하시니까... 한 달에 한 번 열리는 직원들의 생일잔치. 이날은 영옥 씨가 주인공입니다. 몸이 아픈 남편, 대학생이 된 아들과 함께 오래오래 행복하게 살고 싶다는 영옥 씨. 너무 행복합니다. 앞으로 잘 부탁드리겠습니다. 감사합니다. (잘해봅시다요.) 탈북민들이 우리 사회의 구성원으로 확실하게 뿌리 내릴수록 우리 안의 통일도 조금씩 앞당겨지고 있습니다. \n",
